1
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:03,791
"So far in the new Evangelion films."

2
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,666
"EVANGELION:1.11
YOU ARE (NOT) ALONE."

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,375
Mankind's ultimate multipurpose
humanoid decisive weapon.

4
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,375
Artificial human Evangelion.

5
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,583
Shinji Ikari. You're the pilot.

6
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,083
- Launch the Eva.
- There is no way I could!

7
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,333
Stop wasting time.
Get in the Eva or get out.

8
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,791
Don't run away. Don't run away.

9
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:23,833
DON'T RUN AWAY.

10
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:24,916
I'll be the pilot.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,333
Our Eva can beat an Angel.

12
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,250
Our future depends on
defeating the Angels.

13
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,958
15 years ago, half of humanity died
in the Second Impact.

14
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:37,375
If the Angels set off a Third Impact,
humanity will die out.

15
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,000
Why am I even here?

16
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,125
Don't you have faith in him?
In the work he does?

17
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,250
Piloting the Eva is all I have, right?

18
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:47,000
It's the only reason Father sent for me.
That's why I have to be the pilot.

19
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,000
You need to decide if you
want to be an Eva pilot.

20
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,250
I'll do it... I'll pilot my Eva.

21
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,291
You won't die. I will protect you.

22
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,666
He didn't run from piloting the Eva.

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,708
He should be left in charge
unless he wants out!

24
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:01,958
I'm counting on you.

25
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,041
Farewell.

26
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,791
No,
it's just that I don't have anything else.

27
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:05,916
Ayanami!

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,166
I don't know how
I should act at times like this.

29
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,375
Smiling would be a start.

30
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,875
Children with predestined fates.

31
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,291
"EVANGELION:2.22
YOU CAN (NOT) ADVANCE."

32
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,541
Asuka Langley-Shikinami,
Eva Unit 02's pilot.

33
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:18,625
What kind of idiot are you?

34
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,833
Wow, I guess some people
like being an Eva pilot.

35
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,250
Dealing with your father makes you uneasy?

36
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,333
He praised me for the first time.

37
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,583
- Good work, Shinji.
- It made me feel so happy.

38
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,583
This Human Instrumentality Project...
What's NERV really up to?

39
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,833
Protect Katsuragi for me.

40
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,708
I feel warm and fuzzy
when I'm with Shinji.

41
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,458
You're in love, that's what that means!

42
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,708
You're pretty interesting.

43
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,833
You can be happy without one.

44
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,708
Father, Asuka's inside that Eva!

45
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,583
- That is an Angel! Our enemy!
- No!

46
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,750
- It's all Father's fault!
- Running away again?

47
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,333
What's wrong with running away from pain?!

48
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,041
I never want to pilot an Eva again.

49
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,166
Fretting over stuff
like that makes life less fun.

50
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,458
Just to make sure Shinji won't have
to pilot an Eva anymore!

51
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:59,083
I'm here because I'm Shinji Ikari!
Pilot of Evangelion Unit 01!

52
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,708
Give me back Ayanami!

53
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,666
Go on, Shinji!
Do it to make your wish come true!

54
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,541
Even if I'm gone,
there are replacements for me.

55
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,250
Ayanami! Come here!

56
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,833
I'm sorry. In the end,
I couldn't do anything.

57
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,416
That's okay. It's okay...

58
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,291
It's the continuation
of the Second Impact.

59
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,708
The Third Impact is beginning!

60
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,375
- The time has come.
- The world is ending.

61
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,916
"EVANGELION:3.33
YOU CAN (NOT) REDO."

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,666
Shinji Ikari. Don't do anything.

63
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,625
Shouldn't I be piloting Unit 01?!

64
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:26,916
This is crazy, Misato!

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,416
How am I supposed to take this in
all of a sudden?

66
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,083
Because 14 years have passed since then...

67
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,833
We're WILLE, an organization
dedicated to the destruction of NERV!

68
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,750
I'm Kaworu. Kaworu Nagisa.

69
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,750
I'm another child like you
burdened by fate.

70
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,791
Evangelion Unit 13.

71
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,791
When the time comes, you are
to pilot the Eva with him.

72
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,458
Don't pilot no more Evas!

73
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,916
Rei Ayanami doesn't exist anymore, Shinji.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,041
You're lying!

75
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,500
Once awakened, Eva Unit 01
opened the Doors of Guf

76
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,291
and acted as the trigger
to bring about the Third Impact.

77
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,458
You were the key to it all.

78
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,416
- You're the one I saved, right?!
- I don't know.

79
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,041
Let's begin, Fuyutsuki.

80
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,708
Brat Shinji, do you want to
start another Third Impact?!

81
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,208
I'll take those spears for you...
for everyone...

82
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,625
and then the world will go back to normal!

83
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,750
And then even Misato will have to...

84
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,291
- Misato! Activate the DSS choker!
- Don't do this, Shinji.

85
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,916
- Stop it, you stupid brat!
- What the hell is this?

86
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,083
The Fourth Impact.
This is its opening rite.

87
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,750
Is it my fault...?

88
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,833
Because I pulled out the spears?

89
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,000
- This was in my orders.
- Don't look so sad.

90
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,750
We'll meet again, Shinji.

91
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,500
Kaworu! Nothing good ever happens!

92
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,875
You are such a naive brat...

93
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,833
There are no sins
that can't be atoned for.

94
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,666
There is hope. There is always hope.

95
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,208
<span style="s0">While living in this world 
Is like a long trek on a hill </span>

DSRV locked in position.

Dream, you and me together 

115
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,541
It's been 16 years.

116
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,208
To see the renowned City of Flowers
in this state...

117
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,416
it pains my heart.

118
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,500
The L field density is quite high.

119
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,291
The restoration work

120
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:41,500
on Euro NERV Containment Pillar No.1
shall not be more than 720 sec.

121
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,583
What?
That's 180 seconds shorter than planned.

122
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,500
What about the time needed
for getting back?

123
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,875
Well, I just wish only pilots
had to wear these outrageous outfits.

124
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,791
Shut your mouth and get to work.

125
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,166
So, can we get
the Anti-L System activated?

126
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,750
A redo from Stage 4 should work.
All thanks to our predecessors.

127
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,833
"I'll leave this to you."

128

<span style="s0">We will uphold your wishes 
to preserve this city. </span>

129
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,541
Right, let's get to work.

130
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,208
They're coming!

131
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:22,250
<span style="s0">Eva 44A, customized aerial type! 
Incoming from 4 o'clock! </span>

132
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,041
Amazing line-ahead-formation.

<span style="s0">They've formed a colony on their own. 
It's like a new creature now. </span>

134
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:32,541
Mari, please intercept them.
Give us another 560 seconds.

135
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,166
You betcha!

136
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,291
I'll do the honors
of handling all those 44As!

137
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,000
All right, Nagara my gal.
I'll leave you to handle my wire action!

138
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,750
Let's see now...

139
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,916
Yaw, roll and pitch...

140
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,333
This setup is interesting
but feels a bit awkward...

141
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:00,541
Wished they'd at least kept
humanoid points of articulation.

142
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,083
Unit 08,
currently engaging 1st wave of 44As.

143
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:14,833
2nd wave detected. As planned,
all 44As are being drawn to Unit 08.

144
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,583
Operation time available, 420 seconds.

145
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:24,083
Chief, this is slow going.
It's like working on an 8-bit PC.

146
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,500
It's an enigmatic system like the Evas.

147
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,875
Control via human language isn't easy.

148
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:33,291
Stage 4 has been completed.
We're lagging behind quite a bit.

149
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,041
- Keep calm and hurry it up.
- Yes, ma'am!

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,458
Maintain speed. Plus 20 on guide rig.
Keep current pitch.

151
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,291
Steady as she goes.

152
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,083
You're not getting away!

153
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:06,958
Oops.

154
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,541
The 4th wave, huh.

155
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,500
One against many.

156
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,750
Many a small bird drive away a hawk, eh?

157
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,666
Time remaining, 360 seconds.

158
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,833
I can't find a way
to skip ahead to Stage 5.

159
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,875
Anything can be done. Keep digging.

160
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,500
It's impossible. There's not enough time
to overwrite the data!

161
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,791
Nothing is impossible! Add more bypasses!

162
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,833
But Chief, there's just not enough time!

163
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,250
Stop whining!

164
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,291
This is the problem with young men.

165
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,083
Scurry off, ya bums! Get outta here!

166
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,541
Now that was a piece of cake.

167
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:39,166
Well, well...
Mock angels using decoys? Cocky jerks.

168
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,875
Heads up! The Boss Enemy is here!

169
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,708
<span style="s0">A military application of Evas, 
prohibited by the Vatican Treaty. </span>

170
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,541
What a combo to be up against. 

171
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,416
<span style="s0">A positron cannon armed 4444C land battle

172
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,875
Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki
must be testing us.

00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,208
<span style="s0">High energy readings 
from the 44Bs are increasing! </span>

174
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,375
All ships, ready defensive measures.

175
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,291
All hands, brace for impact and EM blast.

176
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,125
4444C is now in firing position. 

177
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,708
44Bs generating massive power surge.

182
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,458
Firing imminent!

183
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,083
Just made it in the nick of time!

184
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,375
If it shoots again, holy moly!

185
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,375
<span style="s0">High energy readings

188
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,000
We're really screwed!

189
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,375
Second shot imminent! 

190
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,291
This is really, really bad! 

191
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,625
Nagara, gal, give me a diversion!

192
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,833
Roger. 

193
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,875
That won't stop me!

194
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,583
Excusez-moi, Eiffel! 

195
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,583
The 4444C is now completely silent.

196
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,791
Operational time left, 30 seconds!

- Algorithm analysis, switching to C.
- Final lock disabled.

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,541
Anti-L System, Stage 5 is now complete!

199
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,708
It's activating, XO!

200
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,291
Restoring the old city area of Paris. 

201
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:08,291
All Euro NERV facility systems rebooting.
Coming back online.

202
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:42,166
Good work, Maya. That was really close.

203
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:47,375
Assault successful.
Misato, please come collect the luggage.

204
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,291
<span style="s0">Roger.

The end crowns the work.

209
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,708
Now a cannibalized Unit 02
can be built anew

210
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,125
and Unit 08 can be modified
to be overlapping-compliant.

211
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,375
No matter where you are,
I'll come get you.

212
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,583
You just wait, Puppy Boy.

213
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:24,416
EVANGELION:3.0+1.01 THRICE UPON A TIME

214
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,791
Tsk! Spineless loser.

215
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,791
Sorry, I'm late.

216
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,916
Are you okay, Ikari?

217
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,416
Hey! The dog's not allowed in there!

218
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,916
Hey there. You're awake.

219
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:36,583
Don't you recognize me?
It's me, Tohji Suzuhara.

220
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,708
Long time no see, Shinji.

221
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,958
I was blown away
when they brought you in here.

222
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,750
I kinda heard what happened to you,
but it was too confusing for me.

223
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,375
Anyway, great to see you're okay.

224
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,916
Can you get up?

225
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,875
Let's go to my house. You must be hungry.

226
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,958
It's a bit chilly out there.

227
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,541
Doctor, the girl said
she doesn't want to change her clothes.

228
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,833
It's okay, I guess.

229
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,833
We're running out of Tamiflu.

230
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,166
Okay. I'll talk to the rations manager.

231
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,041
Sorry, I'm off for the day.

232
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,416
Come on, let's go.

233
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,083
This place is strange.

234
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,916
So many people are here.

235
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,833
You've never seen a crowd?

236
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:48,583
This is Village 3, one of the places
where survivors gathered and settled.

237
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,333
About 1000 people live here.

238
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:54,875
That's the food distribution center.
They hand it out three times a week.

239
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,291
Hello, Doctor.

240
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,708
Hi, Mrs. Matsukata.
It's almost time, make sure you rest.

241
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,500
Are they the two kids
that Kredit asked you to take care of?

242
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,541
Yeah, something like that.
Please be nice to them.

243
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,125
Goodbye.

244
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,583
What's "Kredit"?

245
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:19,458
It's a support organization
created by WILLE.

246
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:24,375
Aside from granting us supplies,
it also aids trading among villages.

247
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,250
Our village can't survive on its own.

248
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,583
What's that?
It's shaped differently than a dog.

249
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,708
That's a cat.

250
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,041
"Cat"?

251
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,666
You've never seen one?

252
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,833
There are 10 of them
living under this train car.

253
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,791
There's cats and dogs here. It's fun.

254
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,791
"Suzuhara
Ring the buzzer in case of emergency"

255
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,458
This is my old but happy home.

256
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,625
A huge house all for ourselves.

257
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,458
We're home! We'll get you some food now.

258
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,916
There you go. Eat while it's hot.

259
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Shinji, you must be hungry.
You should eat.

260
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,333
It's okay.
Join us whenever you feel like eating.

261
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,708
Let's eat!

262
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,666
Yummy, isn't it?

263
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,500
It feels strange in my mouth.
Warm and soft.

264
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,500
That's "yummy."

265
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,791
My daughter knows how to
prepare food so it's just right.

266
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:32,000
She's the best wife in the world.
You'll be surprised when you see her.

267
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,750
We're home. Sorry we're late.

268
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,375
Hi, I was waiting for you.

269
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,750
She's my wife.
Do you recognize her, Shinji?

270
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,541
The Class-Rep.

271
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:47,291
I couldn't believe my ears when I heard.
It still feels like a dream to see you.

272
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,250
It's been so long, Shinji. Ayanami too.

273
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,708
No. I'm not Ayanami.

274
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,291
What? You're not? Then...

275
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,833
Ms. Look-alike!

276
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,458
What's this?

277
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,291
Our daughter Tsubame. Cute, isn't she?

278
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,583
It's a human, but small.
Why did you shrink her?

279
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,416
You've never seen a baby either?

280
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,458
She was even smaller when she was born.

281
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,875
Babies grow up real fast.

282
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,583
This is... "cute"?

283
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:32,666
You betcha! Isn't she the cutest?
She's my daughter, after all!

284
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:38,208
I'm sorry. Did you get scared
because we spoke in a loud voice?

285
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,916
Sorry, Tsubame, did I make you cry?

286
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,708
The Boss is here!

287
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,416
Sorry I'm late.

288
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,541
It's like a miracle. 

289
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,875
What are you doing?

290
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,000
Babies grow up by drinking
their mom's milk.

291
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,625
It's too early for you, Ms. Look-alike.

292
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,791
I don't know. What would Rei Ayanami do?

293
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,541
You're not Rei Ayanami, right?

294
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,250
So you should do what you want.

295
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,375
I can be different?

296
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,625
Hey, Ikari. It's been a while.
It's me, Aida. Kensuke Aida.

297
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,875
It was Kensuke who saved your butt!

298
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,875
I can't count all the times
this survivalist geek came to our rescue.

299
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,541
If it wasn't for him,
we'd be dead a long time ago.

300
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:59,000
Shinji. It's okay if you don't wanna talk,
but eat the food you're given!

301
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:04,625
It's my fault, Mr. Horaki.
I just dragged him here.

302
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,458
Let's leave him be for today.

303
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,208
But, Tohji!

304
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:12,750
Food like this is a real luxury here.
It's beyond rude not to eat it!

305
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,250
I'm talking to you, Shinji!

306
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,125
Dad, you'll wake up Tsubame.

307
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,833
Let's clear the table and set up the beds.

308
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,708
For Ikari and Ms. Look-alike too, Tohji.

309
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:28,458
No, Ikari's coming with me.
I think it'll be better.

310
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:39,041
I'm sure you were surprised
that those two got married.

311
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,833
They were always fighting in school.

312
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:48,041
The hardship they shared after
the Near Third Impact made them an item.

313
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,083
See, Ikari... not just bad things
came out of the N3I.

314
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,750
We're almost there. It's up this slope.

315
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,875
We've arrived.

316
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:25,916
There was a station here,
now it's a lodge. Use it as you like.

317
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Bathroom's at the back of that car.
I'll get some fuel, you go inside.

318
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:43,041
I'm naked. Why aren't you getting
all hot and flustered?

319
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:49,333
Jeez! I can't believe you picked up
this jerk, Ken-Ken.

320
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,500
I'm home.

321
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:55,166
She's my other guest.
She'll stay for a while.

322
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,583
For various reasons,
Shikinami can't show up at the village.

323
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,750
It's just a pain.
Too many Lilin hanging around.

324
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,541
You only respond to the DSS choker.

325
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:20,333
Ken-Ken, you're being too easy on him.
Let him clean up his own mess.

326
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:23,916
He's not eating,
and can't do anything by himself.

327
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Something really traumatic
must've happened.

328
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,041
He's always been like that.

329
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:32,291
He shuts himself off and cares
for nobody. It's his usual practice.

330
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:37,541
Just let him be. He doesn't want to live,
but he can't die either.

331
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,291
Ikari. It's okay for now.

332
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:45,458
It was fate that made us meet again.
You can count on me.

333
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,333
We're friends, right?

334
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,958
I'm happy you're alive, Ikari.

335
00:24:55,833 --> 00:25:00,458
Hey, Rations Manager...
Don't get worked up over all this.

336
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,958
Thanks for your hard work.

337
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,000
Good night, dear.

338
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,416
What's "good night"?

339
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,750
It's what you say
to make everybody sleep at ease.

340
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,416
Good night, Ms. Look-alike.

341
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm tired of pretending to sleep.

342
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,875
Will I ever be able to sleep again?

343
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:15,666
Good morning.

344
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,833
What's "good morning"?

345
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:22,041
It's what you say
when wishing each other a good day.

346
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,625
Good morning, Ms. Look-alike.

347
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:33,875
Ken-Ken wakes up at 6 every day.
He's already gone to work.

348
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,041
There's your breakfast. Just eat already.

349
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:43,500
Well, those are some tight-fitting clothes
you're wearing there.

350
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:47,041
This is Ms. Look-alike. Doc's wife
sent her here to work with us.

351
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:50,625
Ms. Look-alike?
Sounds like she's got baggage.

352
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,166
Is it okay to let her join us?

353
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,250
If she's willing to work, sure.

354
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,916
Work? If it's an order, I'll comply.

355
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,375
It's not an order. It's work.

356
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,375
What's "work"?

357
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,375
Good question.

358
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,416
Never thought about it.

359
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,041
Well, shedding sweat together, I guess.

360
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,458
Shedding sweat.

361
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,041
Use 3 fingers, lightly.

362
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:17,583
Good. Push it down straight and deep.

363
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,958
Don't squeeze it. Hold it gently.

364
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,750
Just need to get the knack of it.

365
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,250
C'mon, slowpoke. Keep pace with us.

366
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:37,291
- Try to catch up.
- Okay.

367
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,291
This is "shedding sweat"?

368
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,333
This is "work"?

369
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:58,541
Oh, dear. The seedlings we planted.

370
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,291
Come on, give me your hand.

371
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:11,416
Good job.
We managed to meet our daily target.

372
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:15,333
Here. A special treat
for working hard on your first day.

373
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,500
What should I say at times like this?

374
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:20,791
Thank you!

375
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,708
Thank you.

376
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,333
Let's go have a bath now!

377
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,625
What's a "bath"?

378
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,125
"Memorial Bathhouse"

379
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:33,666
This is a "bath."

380
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,958
You need to take your clothes off.

381
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:51,291
Bath is strange. It's different than LCL.
It's warm and fuzzy.

382
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:58,500
I'm alive even without orders.

383
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,916
Why?

384
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:07,958
You just want to play the victim,
lying down in that corner, all clammed up.

385
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,541
Get outta my way.

386
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,041
Annoying jerk.

387
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,458
Oh, it's not Mommy.

388
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:20,208
Welcome home, Ms. Look-alike.
Thank you for the hard work.

389
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,333
Sorry I'm late.

390
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,666
Yay! Mommy!

391
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:28,916
- Have you been a good girl?
- Yup!

392
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,958
As always, thank you, Hikari.

393
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,625
Not at all. We're here to help each other.

394
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,791
Right, let's go home.

395
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,750
Yup! Goodbye!

396
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,208
Goodbye.

397
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,583
What's "goodbye"?

398
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:46,750
It's what you say
when you hope we see each other again.

399
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,250
Come on!

400
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,333
Okay.

401
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:51,833
Let's play together at home.

402
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,500
What's that?

403
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:57,500
It's what you do to bond with someone.

404
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,500
I'm sick of this.

405
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,833
You're giving us a hard time too,
you know.

406
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,666
Puking again, I see.

407
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:35,625
Damn brat! You should be grateful
you get fed in the first place!

408
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,583
You're still a mock Lilin.
You won't last if you don't eat.

409
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:40,916
Just swallow it down!

410
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,541
I've been living on water only.

411
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:46,083
Enjoy the taste of crappy food
before your body stops growing.

412
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,291
Idiot brat!

413
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:53,041
You're just idling like that
because you're afraid of getting hurt!

414
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,166
Since you got all this time to yourself,

415
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,125
why don't you think about why I tried
to punch your face in before!

416
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,791
You're so mentally feeble.

417
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:11,000
Whatever you do backfires,
and there's no turning back.

418
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:14,458
It's all your fault, so you don't feel
like doing anything anymore.

419
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:18,916
I know your father told you to do it,
but with your lack of mental toughness

420
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:21,291
I'd rather you didn't pilot the Eva.

421
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,916
Keep sulking and get lost, brat.

422
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,708
I'm home.

423
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:03,208
Where's Ikari?

424
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,000
He ran away.

425
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:10,458
I see. Leaving him alone
might be the best option for now.

426
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:11,625
Where did he go?

427
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,750
The lakeside ruins, north of here.

428
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,875
Where NERV HQ used to be.
Maybe that's fate too. Did he eat?

429
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:22,166
I force-fed him.
Should be okay for a while.

430
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,958
Thanks, Shikinami.

431
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:26,541
I'm not doing it for him.

432
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:30,416
I'd never let him die selfishly
while he still had his head up his ass.

433
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,250
My name?

434
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:49,458
Yes, we can't keep on calling you
Ms. Look-alike.

435
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:53,208
The Doc said you forgot your name.

436
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,791
Why don't you give yourself a new one?

437
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,708
Can I do that?

438
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,666
"Library"

439
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,916
Books...

440
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,291
Shinji mentioned these... 

441
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,833
I found it, so I'm returning it.

442
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,500
Thank you.

443
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:39,208
Wanna read?

444
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:40,791
"Ochibi and the Porcupine"

445
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,250
Thank you.

446
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,791
I'm alone.

447
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,250
Always have been, always will be.

448
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:02,000
And that's just how it is, Asuka.

449
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:08,416
Who is it?

450
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,750
It's me.

451
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Original Batch?

452
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,250
I'll unlock the door.

453
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:20,208
They told me Shinji would be here.

454
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:22,833
He's not here right now. He's run away.

455
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,291
I see. I'll go look for him, then.

456
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,208
Got some news for you.

457
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,833
To prevent us Eva pilots
from transcending human limits,

458
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:32,666
they put limiters on us at design time,
just like the Evas.

459
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,791
That's why we have inefficient emotions.

460
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:38,666
We're designed in compliance
with human cognitive behavior.

461
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:43,416
You Ayanami series are adjusted
to like the Third Boy.

462
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,625
Your feelings were rigged by NERV
since the beginning.

463
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:52,625
I see. But I don't mind.
I'm happy like this.

464
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,166
I see. Do as you please, then.

465
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,666
The object of your affection
is at N109 tower,

466
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,583
inside the NERV 2nd Branch ruins.

467
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,083
Thank you.

468
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:07,000
Bring his rations with you.
He must be running out of fuel by now.

469
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,833
Why aren't you in the village
and working there?

470
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:14,375
Are you an idiot? This isn't a place
I'm supposed to live in.

471
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:15,958
It's a place I protect.

472
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,458
Shinji.

473
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,916
They taught me to return what I found.

474
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:07,750
I'll come again.

475
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:52,791
Is it okay to leave Shinji alone?
Ain't it dangerous?

476
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:57,291
Let's leave him be for now.
He needs time to himself.

477
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:02,500
But, Kensuke...
ain't you a bit too cold towards him?

478
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:05,083
Worrying too much won't help either of us.

479
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:08,666
He'll come back. Let's have faith in him.

480
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,041
You're right.

481
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,666
I hope
he'll blend in with the village soon.

482
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,958
Why don't you come back to the village?

483
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,625
You also aren't doing anything.

484
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,333
Are you protecting the village too?

485
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:37,250
I'm not protecting anything.

486
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,250
I destroyed everything!

487
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:45,250
I don't wanna do anything anymore!
No talking! Don't wanna see anybody!

488
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:49,250
I want to be left alone.

489
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:55,125
Why are you all so nice to me?

490
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,875
Because we like you.

491
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:03,750
Thank you for talking to me.

492
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:09,625
This...
is what you do to bond with someone.

493
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,166
End of escape. Thanks to Original Batch?

494
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,250
Yeah.

495
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:36,875
Cried all your tears
and now you feel relieved?

496
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,541
Yeah.

497
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:45,250
Right. If you can move about,
go help Ken-Ken.

498
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:58,166
Let's hit the road a little.
It'll take your mind off things.

499
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:04,333
I'm a handyman,
so I'm exempt from farming duties.

500
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:08,250
Today we'll go check the outer
infrastructure and environment.

501
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:09,666
It'll be a busy day.

502
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:15,041
But the infrastructure's too old
and doesn't work anymore.

503
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:17,333
It's too difficult to repair,
so it was abandoned.

504
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:31,958
We only pick up fallen sticks
or prune the lower limbs.

505
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,708
Wanna take good care
of what's left of the woods.

506
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:45,208
Village 3 relies on this water.
It's important to check the water level.

507
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:49,958
It's tied to the survival of the village.
It's a real lifeline for us.

508
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:57,208
I'll go check the spring. The trek's
too steep for you. Stay here and work.

509
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,750
Here, help secure some food.

510
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:04,166
No. I've never done it. I can't do it.

511
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,875
Try first, then talk.

512
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:15,333
Don't sweat it. Our quota is one fish
per week. You'll have another chance.

513
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:20,791
That's WILLE's parting gift.

514
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:25,833
A complementarity L-containment field
purification process nullifying unit.

515
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:29,166
Thanks to that thing,
Village 3 has avoided corization.

516
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,125
We owe Misato and her group.

517
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:40,083
They showed up lately.
We call them Wanderers.

518
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:43,875
Headless Evas who were buried
suddenly started moving about.

519
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:45,875
We're monitoring them today.

520
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,541
Yeah, the containment pillars
are keeping them away.

521
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:53,000
Those seals work against
the Wanderers too.

522
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:57,458
There are jobs even a handyman can't do.
If that thing stops working, we're dead.

523
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:05,666
As you can see, we don't know how long
this place can survive.

524
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:10,125
But we're going to struggle on
and live until the very end.

525
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:15,958
Those are pickled plums. Tohji looks
forward to eating them every year.

526
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:20,666
Life is a continuous cycle
of tough times and good times.

527
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:24,750
There's nothing wrong if every day feels
the same as today. That's how it is.

528
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,208
Right now is the youngest I'll ever be.
I want to live to the fullest right now.

529
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,375
And there's Tsubame too.

530
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:36,708
She's more attached to you than me.

531
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:40,625
You should live here with us forever,
Ms. Look-alike.

532
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:43,875
My name?

533
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:46,333
Yeah. Have you picked one?

534
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:48,500
No, not yet.

535
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,750
Ask someone to pick one for you, then.

536
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:52,791
Your name?

537
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:55,958
Yes. I want you to give me a name.

538
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,416
I want to stay here.
To do that, I need a name.

539
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:03,166
I want you to give me one.

540
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,166
A name for you...

541
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:08,333
But you're not Ayanami...

542
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,541
Any name will do.

543
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,875
I want to have a name that you give me.

544
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,041
Is Original Batch functioning all right?

545
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,416
Yeah. She came to see me again today. Why?

546
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:28,083
I see. That's fine, then.

547
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:03,250
I see... I can only live inside NERV. 

548
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:17,166
So, Shinji... have you gotten used
to village life?

549
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,166
Yeah, a little.

550
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,291
That's good to hear.

551
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:23,666
This village was just a ragtag
bunch of strangers.

552
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,375
That's good to hear.

553
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:28,375
Was it hard at the beginning?

554
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,041
Well, let's see...

555
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,625
A lot of stuff happened.

556
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,833
It wasn't a world where
clueless kids could survive.

557
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:41,125
We had to grow up in a hurry
and learn to do everything on our own.

558
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:45,875
I even did things I'm ashamed of
for the sake of my family.

559
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:48,750
Had to throw away my naivety
in order to survive.

560
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:53,375
I'm not really a doctor
or anything prestigious like that.

561
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:56,333
I'm just a stand-in. Self-taught helper.

562
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:59,041
I only make it by thanks to
medical instruments

563
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,750
and facilities from Kredit.

564
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:04,458
Tohji, you should be proud of yourself.
You're helping people.

565
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,833
There are lives I can't save.

566
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,541
But I keep on going.

567
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,750
'Cause shouldering the bereaved's sadness
and anger is part of the job, I think.

568
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:17,958
I've gotta pay for my mistakes.
I mean, take responsibility.

569
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,000
That's what I think.

570
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:25,625
Shinji, you've already fought enough
to protect all of us.

571
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:29,500
From now on, you should stay here
and live with us.

572
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,208
That's what I think.

573
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:43,291
Thanks for coming with me
this early in the morning.

574
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:46,250
I never thought my father,

575
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:50,375
who survived the Near Third Impact,
would die just like that in an accident.

576
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:53,333
I should've had talks with him,

577
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:56,666
had some drinks,
and listened to some of his gripes.

578
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,750
Your father's still alive, right?

579
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:04,333
Even if you think it'd be useless,
try talking to him. Or you'll regret it.

580
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:08,208
We're talking about Gendoh Ikari.
It's too tough for this guy here.

581
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:13,208
But they're father and son.
Ties like that never die.

582
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:27,666
Mrs. Matsukata had a hard time
during labor, but she pulled through.

583
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:31,833
I'm glad the baby was born healthy.
Her husband was crying with joy.

584
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,333
Oh, well. You can laugh after all.

585
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,375
Yes, you're quite cute too.

586
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:46,083
Really. You also have a nice figure.
Why don't you try other clothes?

587
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:49,625
Yes... I'll try wearing
something different.

588
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:54,333
How about this?

589
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:58,125
Looks great on you.

590
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:00,750
- You really are cute.
- I want you to marry my son.

591
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,416
This is "blushing"?

592
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,166
How cute.

593
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,250
This is "embarrassed"?

594
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:16,083
Sorry. This suit's a bit hot,
but keep it on for a while.

595
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:21,041
I'm the jack-of-all-trades handyman,
so I also liaison with Kredit.

596
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:30,958
The L-containment field is weaker here,
so they do restoration experiments.

597
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:32,625
It's Kredit's outdoor lab.

598
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:37,041
There's a staff member I want you to meet.

599
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:40,125
Mr. Aida!

600
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:47,125
It's been too long, sir.
Is that your new assistant?

601
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,583
Yeah, something like that.

602
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:52,083
I've never met an outsider before.

603
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,583
I'm Kaji. Ryoji Kaji.

604
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,041
What's your name?

605
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,166
So, what'd ya think? Nice guy, isn't he?

606
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:06,916
Yes, he is.

607
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,083
But his name... Kaji...

608
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:15,416
Yeah. He's Misato and Kaji's son.
He'll be 14 soon.

609
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,000
He knows nothing about his parents.

610
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,041
That's Ms. Misato's wish.

611
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:24,000
She feels she can't be much of a mother
to him, so she decided to stay away

612
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:27,958
for the rest of her life and protect him
as the head of WILLE instead.

613
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:32,166
What happened to Mr. Kaji?

614
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,666
He died.

615
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,833
Someone had to sacrifice themselves
in order to stop the Third Impact.

616
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:42,916
Mr. Kaji decided he'd be the one.
Ms. Misato let him go.

617
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:48,500
She regrets that you got stuck with all
the baggage on your shoulders, Ikari.

618
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,208
She felt she should have.

619
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:54,666
I think she doesn't want to let you
pilot an Eva because of that.

620
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:59,041
Ikari,
you're not the only one who's hurting.

621
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:01,416
Ms. Misato is in pain as well.

622
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:15,875
The smell of earth...

623
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,916
Mr. Kaji...

624
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:25,125
The Wunder will come by tomorrow.
Your return route is all set up.

625
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,791
The records of the village
Ms. Misato asked for.

626
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,833
Includes crew members' family photos.

627
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:37,458
And here's a letter to Tohji's sister.
He asks kindly for your help.

628
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:39,833
Okay, got it.

629
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,625
I'm home.

630
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:02,708
These are tears?

631
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,625
I'm the one... crying?

632
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,750
Is this how it feels to be lonely?

633
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:21,541
Good morning, Ms. Look-alike.

634
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:36,208
"Good night. Good morning. Thank you..."

635
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,250
"Goodbye."

636
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,666
Good morning.

637
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,541
Good morning.
What's up? You're here early.

638
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,166
I wanted to see you, Shinji.

639
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:54,083
Here.

640
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,375
Thanks.

641
00:52:59,416 --> 00:53:02,958
Um, about that name you asked about...

642
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:07,416
You're still Ayanami.
I can't think of another name.

643
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:11,500
Thank you for thinking about it.

644
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:13,250
I'm happy just the same.

645
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:17,250
I can't survive here.

646
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:19,833
But I like this place.

647
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:22,041
Ayanami?

648
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:25,833
Now I know "like." I'm happy.

649
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:30,875
Ayanami, what's wrong?

650
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:36,333
I wanted to harvest the rice.

651
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,708
I wanted to hold Tsubame more.

652
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:51,791
I wanted to be
with the boy I liked, forever.

653
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:58,041
Goodbye.

654
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:01,500
Ayanami!

655
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:04,625
Really? Ms. Look-alike isn't with you?

656
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,916
What's wrong?

657
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:43,541
So that's the Wunder, huh?
Jeez, it's huge.

658
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:48,000
The people who want to leave
are disembarking.

659
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,000
The final battle is near.

660
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,416
Hey, stop filming me!

661
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,833
Sorry, but I want to keep
a record of today.

662
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,250
I see. Do as you please, then.

663
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,583
So, why did you come here?

664
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:19,708
Ikari, you can stay behind, you know.

665
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:23,125
Thank you, Kensuke.

666
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Please give my thanks
to Tohji and the others.

667
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:31,666
I'll go with you, Asuka.

668
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,916
I see. Well, these are the rules, so...

669
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,166
Suzuhara...

670
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,458
Sakura.

671
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:53,000
I said don't pilot no more Evas,
but you ran away and did just that!

672
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,000
You jerk! You absolute jerk!

673
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:57,500
You're such a jerk, Mr. Ikari!!

674
00:55:58,541 --> 00:55:59,916
What are you, his wife?

675
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,625
The status of the escapee
has been verified.

676
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:16,791
Taking over responsibility of BM-03's
monitoring and restrainment as of now.

677
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:23,416
Please sign here, Temporary Special
Senior Major Langley-Shikinami.

678
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:26,416
No DSS choker?

679
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:30,000
There's no need.

680
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:34,916
He'll be held in the blast containment
chamber until the end of the mission.

681
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,916
<span style="s0">Monitored Target Subject BM-03 arrived 
at Chamber 2. Ready detonation systems. </span>

682
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,875
<span style="s0">You figured it's the best solution 
since he managed to take it off, huh? </span>

683
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:48,666
MAGI Copy has record of choker activation. 

684
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:54,166
<span style="s0">It shows that the other pilot blew up 
right in front of Mr. Ikari's eyes. </span>

685
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,625
<span style="s0">Even after experiencing such trauma, 
he still came back to the Wunder.</span>

686
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,166
Why? 

687
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:06,666
Who knows. Captain Katsuragi letting him
on board is more of a mystery to me.

688
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:11,375
Village 3's visual record and
personal correspondence from Suzuhara.

689
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:12,500
"To Sakura with love!
Your Big Bro"

690
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:13,666
From Tohji...

691
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,416
Chamber 2's total enclosure 

692
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,541
<span style="s0">and emergency blast activation system 
is online. </span>

693
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:24,500
<span style="s0">Quarantine procedures for Monitored 
Target Subject BM-03 are now complete. </span>

694
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:32,458
Covering for disembarked personnel OK.

695
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:34,166
New Unit 02 works are on track.

696
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,583
Start installation
of Unit 08i's power shift.

697
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:39,833
Sit-rep on main turrets
and exterior works?

698
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:44,250
<span style="s0">Replacement of Turret 4 and addition of 
the aft turret is proceeding nominally. </span>

699
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:48,666
<span style="s0">Work on Eva in the ship external dock 
is lagging behind by a total of 3%. </span>

700
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,125
Speed is Priority One. 

701
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:51,916
<span style="s0">We'll rush through 
the first 1/5 of the checklist! </span>

702
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,291
Yes, ma'am! 

703
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:56,791
<span style="s0">N1 Rocket's secondary coupling 
will restart in 5 minutes. </span>

704
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,083
Got no problem with picking up
Major Shikinami.

705
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:02,291
But why did that jinx come along with her?

706
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:05,375
Better than letting NERV use him again.

707
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:09,375
All personnel is authorized to shoot him
if he tries to board the Eva.

708
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:10,666
Reassuring enough, no?

709
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,208
That's just talk. No substance.

710
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:16,208
I mean, the Captain didn't
neutralize him when he escaped.

711
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:18,791
My faith in her is zero now.

712
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:21,541
He's still a child.
I understand her hesitation.

713
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:26,208
That "child" caused the Near Third Impact
that wiped out my whole family.

714
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:28,916
The N3I was just
an unintended consequence.

715
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,583
And the Captain
is doing all she can to atone.

716
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:37,541
I agree. Kaji entrusted WILLE to her.
I trust her all the way.

717
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:40,541
You're all too soft on them.

718
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:46,875
Like this water made with someone's pee...
You think purifying it is enough.

719
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,791
Doesn't work like that.

720
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,750
<span style="s0">New Unit 02, JA components 
connection test is a go. </span>

721
00:58:57,458 --> 00:59:01,250
<span style="s0">Start left arm independent coordination 
system work as planned. </span>

722
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:06,500
They've added even more explosives.
They're losing faith in us.

723
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,416
I'm back.

724
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:15,125
Welcome back, Highness. Good job.
I missed you so much!

725
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:20,333
Jeez, look at this room!
You're hoarding even more books.

726
00:59:20,416 --> 00:59:22,666
Books are the aggregate of human wisdom.

727
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:27,291
My impossible dream is to read
every book in the world.

728
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:31,541
By the way, any progress with Puppy Boy?

729
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,833
I'm not interested.

730
00:59:33,916 --> 00:59:37,583
Oh! You care not for teenage boys.

731
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:40,791
That brat doesn't need a lover.

732
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:42,333
He needs a mother.

733
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:46,958
<span style="s0">All loading from logistic support ships 
has been completed. </span>

the operational independence of Kredit

736
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:55,916
and removal of all restrictors
on the Evas,

737
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,166
Captain Katsuragi.

738
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:03,041
Captain and XO approval verified.

739
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:04,833
Maya, please get started.

740
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:06,458
Roger, senior XO. 

741
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:11,666
You're always here
when you want to be alone.

742
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,791
Maybe we should have this
be the Captain's quarters.

743
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:18,500
You can't forget Ryoji that easily, huh?

744
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:21,958
It's not about Kaji.
I can relax better here. That's all.

745
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:27,250
Well, this section houses
the primary mission of this ship.

746
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:29,166
Conservation of all species.

747
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:34,583
An unmanned, totally autonomous ark
with near-perpetual operation capability.

748
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:36,541
That's AAA Wunder's true nature.

749
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:42,166
For Kaji, the survival of mankind
wasn't very important.

750
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:46,083
He held the highest priority on
preserving all the diverse life forms

751
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:50,250
that the Human Instrumentality Project
would obliterate.

752
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:55,333
He wanted to evacuate as many seeds of
life as possible outside of the Earth.

753
01:00:56,166 --> 01:01:00,708
So he seized this ship from NERV
while it was still being built.

754
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,666
He felt it was impossible for humanity
to stop the Instrumentality Project.

755
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:10,958
But he gave his life
to stop the Third Impact in the end.

756
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:14,750
He died in the most self-contradicting,
selfish way. Super annoying jerk.

757
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:21,625
And now he's gone.

758
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:26,000
So I'll use this ship to annihilate NERV, 

759
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:29,208
<span style="s0">and thwart 
their Human Instrumentality Project. </span>

760
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:31,416
So you can get revenge? 

761
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:35,125
No. Instead of an ark to preserve life, 

762
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:37,083
it'll be a battleship that saves lives. 

763
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:41,583
You really sound like a mother.

764
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:45,416
I have no right at all
to be called "mother."

765
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,083
Captain and XO on navigation bridge.

766
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:56,916
NERV HQ has started moving. 

767
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,375
<span style="s0">It's most likely directed to 
Ground Zero in the former South Pole. </span>

768
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:01,875
Together with the Black Moon. 

769
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:21,875
<span style="s0">The restorationof the Black Moon, 
necessary for the Fourth Impact. </span>

770
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:25,583
The resurrection of
the Advanced Ayanami series,

771
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:30,375
untainted life forms made with
pure souls free of sexual distinction,

772
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:33,708
which shall be the sacrificial offering
to the Vessel of the Adams.

773
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:38,500
And the Human Instrumentality Project,
humanity's attempt of self-salvation.

774
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:42,833
Look where that arrogance has led us.

775
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:52,333
The Third Boy has returned to WILLE.

776
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:58,375
Ayanami #6 was not properly calibrated,
and it seems to have lost its form.

777
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:04,125
Did you make him go through the same loss
as you to teach him something,

778
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:06,250
Ikari?

779
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,750
He seems to be psychologically stable.

780
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:18,791
So, Captain Katsuragi. What do you want
to do with Shinji Ikari?

781
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:20,958
Never meet him again, just like your son?

782
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:24,833
Keeping him in custody will be enough.
No need for me to see him.

783
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:28,583
You're sure he doesn't need
to have a DSS choker?

784
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:33,708
There's no point in redemption unless
you're willing to atone for your sins.

785
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:40,041
Misato. You're acting all tough,
but in truth you're happy he's back.

786
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:45,958
Actions driven by emotions
only bring trouble. You know that.

787
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,958
You don't pull punches, as always.

788
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:53,583
Being soft on you only brings trouble.
I know that.

789
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:04,000
Nothing else changes in my body,
but my hair keeps growing. How annoying.

790
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:10,250
Gods, corruption, and desires...
they dwell within the fibers of hair.

791
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:13,583
It embodies the chaos of the human mind.

792
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:17,250
It's unequivocal proof
that you are a human, Your Highness.

793
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:37,625
<span style="s0">The cursed Ground Zero 
of the Second Impact. </span>

794
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:41,041
All the Vessel of the Adams are ready.

795
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:45,291
The reactivation of Unit 13
is only a matter of time.

796
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:49,166
Right. Let us start, Fuyutsuki.

797
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:52,583
Take care of the rest.

798
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:58,666
So far, everything is going
according to SEELE's scenario.

799
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:05,791
Go on, Shinji!

800
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:08,416
Do this for yourself!

801
01:05:09,791 --> 01:05:11,916
Do it to make your wish come true!

802
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:24,458
<span style="s0">Captain, I have bad news. NERV HQ 
has arrived at its final destination. </span>

803
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:27,166
The reactivation of Unit 13 has started. 

804
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:31,125
That means we have only
a few hours left, right?

805
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,083
Yes, but I have good news. 

806
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:38,208
<span style="s0">Shutdown signal plug is ready. Both Evas 
are too, at their bare minimum state. </span>

Rash as always.

810

All stations, prepare for launch,
battle stations condition 2!

811
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:52,041
Take off in 25 minutes.

812
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:54,625
All hands,

817
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,250
You have many bandanas, Chief Takao.

818
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:26,083
Yeah. One for each comrade who died
when we rose against NERV.

819
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:30,875
This is how you told apart enemies
and allies during the revolt, right?

820
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:35,125
Yeah, we want to return the color of
the sea and the land back to this color.

821
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:38,250
It's the symbol of our promise.

822
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:41,125
Thanks.

823
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:44,625
This bandana has become Ryoji's memento.

824
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:05,791
Take care of yourself, Katsuragi.

825
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:10,958
Truth be told... 

826
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,750
I wanted to stay behind
with Kaji back then.

827
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:19,416
I know. Maybe he would have let you,
if you weren't expecting.

828
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:25,291
I need to go to battle stations,
so I'll be at sickbay.

829
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,500
Mr. Ikari, please don't go anywhere.

830
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:31,083
Use the red button to call me
if you need to.

831
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:33,750
I'll be on my way.

832
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:44,875
An extra deep depth pressure resistant
experimental plug suit.

833

Seems it's brand spanking new.

834
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:51,333
Of course they gave us brand-new suits.
They're our burial clothes.

835
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:59,083
New Unit 02, JA reactor activated. 

836
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:01,750

Um, I don't know...

847
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:44,541
I'll give you a hint. Rooftop and glasses.

848
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,958
Gorgeous gal with big boobs.

849
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,625
The parachute girl?

850
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:51,041
Bingo!

851
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:56,500
I didn't introduce myself.
I'm Mari Illustrious-Makinami.

852
01:08:57,125 --> 01:09:00,250
Nice to meet you again, WILLE puppy.

853
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,583
You changed a bit.
You smell more grown-up, I guess?

854
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:09,916
Doesn't change that easily, that brat.

855
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:12,958
It's the end, so I'll ask.

856
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:16,916
Did you figure out
why I wanted to clobber you?

857
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:23,500
It's because I couldn't make up my mind

858
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:26,583
when you were inside Unit 03.

859
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,625
I didn't help you and I didn't kill you.

860
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,500
Because I didn't want
to take responsibility.

861
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,875
You did grow up a bit.

862
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:40,333
It's the end, so I'll tell you.

863
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:44,458
That boxed lunch you made for me,
it was pretty tasty.

864
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:48,125
I think I had a crush on you back then.

865
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:52,875
But I've turned into an adult
ahead of you.

866
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:55,916
Bye.

867
01:09:57,791 --> 01:10:02,125
You're doing great.
You should be proud, Shinji Ikari.

868
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:04,500
Zaijian! See ya!

869
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:10,333
Feel better now, Highness?

870
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,875

to rest that you can call your own.

873
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:26,416
The ties that bind you
will show you the way.

874

We'll meet again.

875
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:35,750
You're right, Kaworu.

Unmanned fleet has been
locked into position for launch.

882

Stop all extravehicular work now.
Non-combatants in stand-by.

All stations are now

Captain, all stations ready for launch.

Start descent to target.
Initiate re-entry.

899
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:12,500
Aye aye. Entering atmosphere.

900
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:30,208
Monitors back online.

901
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:35,083
Proceeding to Ground Zero.

902
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:37,041
Entering L-c field barrier surface.

903
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,208
Navigating L-containment field barrier
surface. All systems go.

904
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:56,000
We're above the L-c field that rejects
all life stained by the original sin.

905
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:02,458
Humanity is advancing through this
purified area without being blessed.

906
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:05,541
All thanks to Kaji's data
and the Anti-L System.

20 to dive possible point in L-c field.

Starboard hull No.2 hit! Damage unknown!

910

Enemy ship sighted at 3 o'clock!

911

The No.2 ship Erlösung

912
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,958
So they've completed it.

913
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:32,875
Sorry, but we'll have to indulge Ikari
with his games a bit more.

914
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:39,541
Trying to buy time to stop

915
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:42,375
Same God-slaying power as us. Tricky.

916

Bring it on!

917
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:45,333
Starboard guns, ready to fire!

918
01:14:45,416 --> 01:14:48,875
We'll hold that NERV ship at bay
as we hurry to the diving point.

919
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:50,375
Fire!

920
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:13,916
We've taken multiple hits!
Their firepower's overwhelming!

921
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,375
How can that be
the same class ship as this?

922
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:20,791
Our ship's unfinished, that's why.
But when it comes to propulsion power...

923
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:22,333
we win!

924
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:31,458
L-c field diving point reached!

925
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:33,375
- Emergency dive!
- Aye aye!

926
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,125
Going through L-c field layer 1.

927
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:53,791
Entering layer 2. L-containment field
strength density +30.

928
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:57,000
Eva Infinity swarm
dead ahead at 12 o'clock!

929
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:59,250
No matter. We'll blitz through them.

930
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:07,791
Enemy ship sighted at 12 o'clock!

931
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:08,875
An ambush?

932
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:16,166
No.3 ship, the Erbsünde...
We got caught in a pincer attack.

933
01:16:21,541 --> 01:16:24,666
This is bad! Our navigation will fail
if we're hit anymore!

934
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,291
No.3 ship has poor outfitting.
We'll sink it first.

935
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:29,750
Helm steady. Maximum battle speed!

936
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:30,916
Aye aye!

937
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,541
No.3 ship taking evasive action!

938
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:47,833
Don't let her get away! Ram into her!

939
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:57,875
This is nuts!

940
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,500
Turn us around! Roll 180 degrees!

941
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:05,458
We'll switch positions!

942
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:07,041
Aye aye!

943
01:17:23,458 --> 01:17:25,791
Using the No.3 ship as a shield...

944
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:28,458
Reckless as usual.

945
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:39,083
We've broken through the Infinity swarm.
Entering L-c field layer 3.

946
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:42,833
Acquired target, NERV HQ. It has already
shifted below the Black Moon.

947
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:47,041
Unit 13's reactivation is imminent.

948
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:50,208
No.2 and No.3 ship gaining on our aft.

949
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:55,166
We're out of time. We'll use the Moon
as a cover and set course for assault.

950
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,166
Ready launch of guided munitions.

951
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,666
Set target
to Unit 13 Re-adjustment sector.

952
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:03,000
NERV Battleships approaching
our aft at 6 o'clock!

953
01:18:04,541 --> 01:18:07,625
Tilt the ship.
Reduce our target size to a minimum.

954
01:18:07,708 --> 01:18:09,083
Aye aye!

955
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:12,291
Blow port gravity ballast. Down 20.

956
01:18:12,375 --> 01:18:16,625
Protect the ships on the main wings.
Concentrate our A.T. Field!

957
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:27,708
Aft main gun hit badly!
They're beating us blind!

958
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:30,791
Don't panic!
Just need to hold until launch point.

959
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:39,791
10 until guided munitions launch point.

960
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:42,875
Trajectory clear!

961
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:44,708
Launch all guided munitions!

962
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:47,166
Launching all guided munitions.

963
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:12,458
Got a visual on final target, Unit 13!

964
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:16,250
As expected, it hasn't reactivated yet.
Unit 13 is still immobile.

965
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:23,166
Eva 7 Series is inbound!

966
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:25,916
Gazillions of them! Impossible to count.

967
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,875
Ignore the small fry.
Expedite Evas' launch!

968
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:31,083
Maya! Ready launch of both Evas!

969
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:34,625
- Roger. Readying launch of both Evas!
- Launch!

970
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Mari, Asuka, I'm counting on you.

971
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:08,250
Out of my way!

972
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:30,583
Coming through! Sorry, guys!

973
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:43,791
Four-Eyed Crony! Next weapon!

974
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,291
Okeydokey.

975
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,166
Next!

976
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:13,250
Highness!

977
01:21:45,208 --> 01:21:47,791
Mock Evas ganging up to block the way.
How annoying!

978
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:56,750
Four-Eyed Crony! Gimme a hand!

979
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:58,291
Gotcha!

980
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:29,375
Both our Evas landed on NERV HQ!

981
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,833
Our target must be below that crater.

982
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:57,875
These guys...

983
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:00,625
are way too much of a pain!

984
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:11,208
Go ahead, Your Highness!

985
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:13,208
Thanks, Four-Eyed Crony!

986
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:39,291
Eva Unit 13...

987
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:41,416
We made it...

988
01:23:47,833 --> 01:23:49,541
Even if they call it "God's Eva,"

989
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:54,916
it's just the 13th man-made ultimate
multipurpose humanoid decisive weapon.

990
01:23:57,333 --> 01:24:00,125
If I shoot the shutdown override
signal plug into the core,

991
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:04,500
even if we can't destroy it,
it won't be able to move.

992
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,916
This is...

993
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:10,625
the end!

994
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:18,708
An A.T. Field?

995
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:23,166
Unit 13 isn't supposed
to have an A.T. Field...

996
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,541
Why?

997
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:28,666
Wait, is this my Eva's A.T. Field?

998
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:31,708
New Unit 02 is afraid of Unit 13?

999
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:46,458
Something's wrong.

1000
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,916
What are you scheming, Gendoh?

1001
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:56,791
This is weird.
NERV ships are pulling back.

1002
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:58,083
They're descending.

1003
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:16,250
That's the cursed Ground Zero
of the Second Impact, Calvary base!

1004
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:19,833
The Gates of Hell are open once more.

1005
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:20,916
Does this mean...

1006
01:25:25,666 --> 01:25:27,125
Wings of light?

1007
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:31,791
<span style="s0">They want to cause the Fourth Impact 
using the same method as the Second? </span>

1008
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:36,500
<span style="s0">No. They can't use the ships built to 
be the Guardians of Guf as a trigger. </span>

1009
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:40,333
<span style="s0">Besides, what's happening to 
the Black Moon isn't part of the plan. </span>

1010
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:44,666
<span style="s0">This isn't in SEELE's scenario. 
It's a rite we know nothing about. </span>

1011
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:48,041
<span style="s0">A totally unpredicted 
Another Impact, I see. </span>

1012
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:53,833
<span style="s0">This changes nothing. 
We'll crush all of NERV's plans! </span>

1013
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:57,166
Ready main guns. Take out No.3 ship first.

1014
01:25:57,250 --> 01:26:00,166
All available guns, target No.3!

1015
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:04,083
Ready super EM direct impact shells.
No director calculations needed.

1016
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:06,291
All turrets, initiate fire
as soon as you're ready!

1017
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:09,291
But there were 4 ships
in the construction plan.

1018
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:10,833
Fire!

1019
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,250
Give me a sit-rep!

1020
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:19,083
Direct hit! Something pierced
our starboard and port secondary hulls!

1021
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:21,833
Stern damaged.
Main gun systems are now down!

1022
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,541
No.4 ship, Gebet.

1023
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:34,291
We've fallen into their trap.

1024
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:41,666
They'll need this thing to complete
the final impact anyway.

1025
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:45,083
So I have to get rid of it right now.

1026
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:48,791
It's right in front of me,
but I can't get through...

1027
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:52,875
Time for the last resort.
I'm sorry, New Unit 02.

1028
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,833
I gotta make you go all-out.

1029
01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:57,041
Disable all restrictors.

1030
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:59,333
Backdoor code Triple Nine.

1031
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:23,000
Pattern blue! I have readings
of the 9th Angel within NERV HQ!

1032
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:28,166
Are you going to use
the power of an Angel?

1033
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:39,791
Angel Blood...

1034
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:42,208
Full injection!

1035
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:36,291
Highness, you won't be human anymore!

1036
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:49,208
I'll neutralize
New Unit 02's A.T. Field...

1037
01:28:49,291 --> 01:28:52,416
with my own A.T. Field!

1038
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,000
It's not a single entry plug system?

1039
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:47,750
Oh, no! Gendoh wanted Princess
to become an Angel!

1040
01:30:02,416 --> 01:30:03,666
Shikinami type?

1041
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:06,041
My original, huh.

1042
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:14,708
The last Eva's form mirrors that of a God.

1043
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:17,750
All you need to do is accept me
along with my love.

1044
01:30:18,416 --> 01:30:20,583
Come to me.

1045
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:24,958
Tough luck.

1046
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:32,083
That's pointless, my cute idiot.

1047
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,500
Asuka!

1048
01:30:56,583 --> 01:31:00,166
New Unit 02's signal has gone dark!
Pilot status, unknown!

1049
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:04,791
N2 reactor APU, heavy damage!

1050
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:06,750
Damn! What now?

1051
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:13,250
Something like an Eva
is attached to the ship!

1052
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:19,791
Pattern blue. It's an Opfer Type Eva.

1053
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:22,041
They built a Mk.9 and pilot from scratch?

1054
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:32,791
This is bad!
Our ship's being physically infiltrated!

1055
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:33,875
Expunge it now!

1056
01:31:33,958 --> 01:31:38,083
We're trying, but the contamination speed
is too fast, we can't keep up!

1057
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,458
Mk.9 has broken through the VD firewall!

1058
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:48,791
We're screwed!
All control systems hijacked!

1059
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,416
Well, we're in a real pickle.

1060
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:06,541
Impressive as always,
Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki.

1061
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:23,958
The artificial recreation of Lilith.

1062
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:27,125
The forced conversion
of the Black Moon to become spears.

1063
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:30,083
The stage is set.

1064
01:32:30,166 --> 01:32:33,166
How will you bring the drama
to a close, Ikari?

1065
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:38,041
Intruder on the bow deck!

1066
01:32:40,541 --> 01:32:41,958
Commander Ikari.

1067
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,500
I'm sorry, Highness.

1068
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:52,291
I'm filled with unbearable shame.

1069
01:32:53,375 --> 01:32:56,291
It seems I have no choice
but to withdraw for now.

1070
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,416
It's been some time.

1071
01:33:09,583 --> 01:33:11,083
Commander Ikari.

1072
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:16,166
I compliment you on your hard work,
Colonel Katsuragi.

1073
01:33:17,166 --> 01:33:20,541
I shall now employ this ship
as previously planned.

1074
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:24,458
It's you...

1075
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:27,416
Shoot first, ask questions later, I see...

1076
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:31,375
No hesitation when it comes to
accomplishing your goal, as usual.

1077
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:34,125
Yeah. I learned from you.

1078
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:49,000
Gods need no barriers.

1079
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:53,083
We accept everything that comes our way.

1080
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:55,333
Gendoh Ikari.

1081
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:59,000
You've used the Key of Nebuchadnezzar
and willingly abandoned your humanity?

1082
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:02,291
I merely appended upon my body

1083
01:34:02,375 --> 01:34:04,833
information that transcends
the Logos of our realm.

1084
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:06,333
There are no problems.

1085
01:34:11,416 --> 01:34:16,041
I'll slay the Gods,
bind them with humanity,

1086
01:34:16,125 --> 01:34:18,000
and through the sacrifice of Angels,

1087
01:34:18,083 --> 01:34:21,041
enable the deification
and the instrumentality of humankind.

1088
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:24,958
And you intend to sacrifice Asuka
to do this, Gendoh Ikari?!

1089
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:28,166
The Ayanami and Shikinami type pilots

1090
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:31,083
were prepared specifically for this.

1091
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,458
There are no problems.

1092
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:03,958
Humanity...

1093
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:08,708
No, all ancient life of this planet
is being commoditized.

1094
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:12,125
All souls are converted to cores,

1095
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:16,083
and merged with the Eva Infinities.
Is this the start of the Fourth Impact?

1096
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:20,250
Correct.

1097
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:23,958
The Second Impact purified the oceans. 

1098
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:26,166
The Third purified the earth. 

1099
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:29,875
The Fourth shall purify the souls. 

1100
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:35,041
<span style="s0">The cores that form the Eva Infinities 
are the materialization of souls. </span>

1101
01:35:36,541 --> 01:35:39,208
<span style="s0">We'll cast aside our vessel, 
the seeds of man, </span>

1102
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:43,541
<span style="s0">and our collective intelligence 
will be guided to unsullied paradise </span>

1103
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:44,708
in this final rite. 

1104
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:47,916
In exchange for bringing about
the Second Impact,

1105
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,958
your father, Doctor Katsuragi
proved the validity of his proposal,

1106
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:56,166
the Human Instrumentality Project.

1107
01:35:56,916 --> 01:35:59,875
I will stop my father's
raving gibberish at all costs.

1108
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:05,708
Having tasted the fruit of knowledge,
only two paths await humanity.

1109
01:36:05,791 --> 01:36:09,750
<span style="s0">Be exterminated by the Angels 
that have been given the fruit of life. </span>

1110
01:36:09,833 --> 01:36:12,958
<span style="s0">Or exterminate the Angels 
and rob them of their seats before God, </span>

1111
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:14,500
surrender our intellect 

1112
01:36:14,583 --> 01:36:17,875
<span style="s0">and become the divine offspring 
enjoying eternal life. </span>

1113
01:36:18,375 --> 01:36:21,166
We must choose one of these two fates. 

1114
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:24,416
<span style="s0">NERV's Human Instrumentality Project 
was the product </span>

1115
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:28,208
<span style="s0">of SEELE choosing the latter, 
a feeble resistance against the Gods </span>

1116
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:30,750
by employed the powers of Adams. 

1117
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:33,500
Nevertheless,
a worthwhile cause to pursue.

1118
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:39,250
We'll reject a plan that bows down to
the Gods and pursues a hard reset.

1119
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:41,958
We'll continue on with hope in ourselves.

1120
01:36:42,041 --> 01:36:45,208
I have faith that humanity's
will and knowledge

1121
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:47,458
will one day overcome
the power of the Gods.

1122
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:50,500
It's all a matter
of interpretation of the truth.

1123
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:53,625
Colonel Katsuragi,
you are forsaking the world.

1124
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:56,791
Doctor Akagi, you are blind
to what happiness has to offer.

1125
01:36:57,416 --> 01:37:00,166
Human sentiments cannot change anything.

1126
01:37:02,166 --> 01:37:05,458
All the horsemen have assembled now.

1127
01:37:14,458 --> 01:37:19,041
So, I will now have you return
the Eva Unit 01 that I lent to you.

1128
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:23,083
Father!

1129
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,541
We survived the Near Third Impact
and everything.

1130
01:38:37,166 --> 01:38:40,458
I'm going to believe in our luck
and Ms. Misato's WILLE.

1131
01:38:44,291 --> 01:38:47,250
Beyond the Doors of Guf
is the anti-universe,

1132
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:49,125
a realm Wunder cannot enter.

1133
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,291
WILLE no longer has the ability
to stop the Instrumentality Project.

1134
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:56,916
We're at the end of our rope.

1135
01:38:57,916 --> 01:38:59,333
Ms. Misato.

1136
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:02,750
I'll pilot Eva Unit 01.

1137
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,791
On my way home after Ayanami disappeared,

1138
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:28,166
I noticed the smell of earth.
I learned it from Mr. Kaji.

1139
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:34,208
I want to take half the burden off of you.

1140
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:39,166
Doing that means you're going
to fight Gendoh Ikari.

1141
01:39:43,583 --> 01:39:46,208
I want to settle things for myself.

1142
01:39:58,083 --> 01:39:59,333
Wait a second!

1143
01:40:00,166 --> 01:40:04,125
Are you joking? You're not going to
let him pilot an Eva, are you?

1144
01:40:07,125 --> 01:40:09,166
I was afraid something like this
might happen.

1145
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,166
You authorized us to shoot to kill
in situations like this, right, Captain?

1146
01:40:15,166 --> 01:40:16,583
You're a plague.

1147
01:40:16,666 --> 01:40:21,250
That N3I you started
made our lives a living hell!

1148
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:24,666
This is all you and your father's fault!

1149
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:27,000
I'll never forgive you two.

1150
01:40:32,458 --> 01:40:33,458
Sakura?

1151
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:36,000
Shinji Ikari won't pilot an Eva.

1152
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:40,166
Mr. Ikari piloted an Eva
and brought misfortune on us

1153
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,750
and upon himself.

1154
01:40:42,833 --> 01:40:45,583
That's why Mr. Ikari won't pilot an Eva!

1155
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:48,500
I'm sorry, Ms. Sakura.

1156
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:51,041
Please let me pilot the Eva.

1157
01:40:51,125 --> 01:40:53,958
You're talking total hogwash!

1158
01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:56,958
Once you're hurt,
you won't have to use the Eva.

1159
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:59,750
It'll hurt, but it's better
than having to be the pilot.

1160
01:40:59,833 --> 01:41:01,458
Please bear with me!

1161
01:41:04,166 --> 01:41:06,083
- Misato?!
- Captain!

1162
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,458
Ms. Misato?!

1163
01:41:09,208 --> 01:41:10,791
It's okay, Shinji.

1164
01:41:11,875 --> 01:41:15,291
Had you not piloted Eva Unit 01
14 years ago,

1165
01:41:15,375 --> 01:41:17,916
we would have already been exterminated.

1166
01:41:18,666 --> 01:41:20,416
That's why I'm grateful to you,

1167
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:23,583
even if N3I happened as a consequence.

1168
01:41:25,041 --> 01:41:28,416
I am entirely responsible
for your actions.

1169
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:32,333
I, Misato Katsuragi,
still have custody of Shinji Ikari.

1170
01:41:32,416 --> 01:41:35,916
I'll take full responsibility
for his subsequent actions.

1171
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,750
Right now,
I want to entrust everything to Shinji.

1172
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:50,750
That's right! We're all in debt
to Mr. Ikari for saving us!

1173
01:41:50,833 --> 01:41:54,250
But my father, and so many others,
were lost to N3I!

1174
01:41:54,333 --> 01:41:57,625
Mr. Ikari is our savior and our destroyer!

1175
01:41:57,708 --> 01:42:00,000
We've got no other choice!

1176
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:05,416
It's alright. Let it go, Sakura.

1177
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:08,916
Let's just think about
what we do in the future.

1178
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:12,916
This is... all so...

1179
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,416
Sorry there, folks!

1180
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:26,250
Doing some prep work made me late.

1181
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:29,166
Now let's go, Puppy Boy.

1182
01:42:31,791 --> 01:42:34,625
Maya, bring the plug suit
from the Captain's quarters.

1183
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:42,208
The bullet will dissolve quickly.
I'll do first aid on you.

1184
01:42:42,291 --> 01:42:43,958
It's okay, Lieutenant.

1185
01:42:45,833 --> 01:42:47,125
Shinji Ikari...

1186
01:42:48,333 --> 01:42:51,666
the only thing a son can do for his father

1187
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:55,291
is pat him on his shoulder or kill him.

1188
01:42:55,875 --> 01:42:56,958
Kaji's words.

1189
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:01,208
Ms. Misato, I met Ryoji Kaji.

1190
01:43:02,041 --> 01:43:03,375
Was he well?

1191
01:43:03,458 --> 01:43:04,458
Yes.

1192
01:43:05,083 --> 01:43:07,166
That's good to hear.

1193
01:43:07,916 --> 01:43:09,625
He's such a nice guy.

1194
01:43:10,166 --> 01:43:13,291
I only talked to him for a short while,
but I liked him.

1195
01:43:14,125 --> 01:43:15,333
Thank you.

1196
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:19,875
I'll back you up.

1197
01:43:20,375 --> 01:43:22,416
I'm counting on you, Shinji.

1198
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:28,458
Okay, Ms. Misato. I'll go now.

1199
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:29,833
Take care, Shinji.

1200
01:43:49,375 --> 01:43:50,958
Let's get back to work.

1201
01:43:51,041 --> 01:43:54,541
The ship is falling apart.
Main and auxiliary engines are gone.

1202
01:43:54,625 --> 01:43:56,416
It's a miracle we're still afloat.

1203
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:58,250
That's fine.

1204
01:43:58,333 --> 01:44:01,916
We'll work another miracle
before the backup power runs out.

1205
01:44:03,041 --> 01:44:05,416
Eva Unit 08 Improved
is overlapping-compliant.

1206
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:09,083
By incorporating Vessel of the Adams,
it's in an extra four-in-one state.

1207
01:44:09,166 --> 01:44:12,000
So we can navigate
through the anti-universe.

1208
01:44:12,083 --> 01:44:13,750
Pretty nifty.

1209
01:44:14,708 --> 01:44:15,791
Okay, Puppy Boy.

1210
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:19,583
Your job is to destroy Unit 13
before all the Anti-L Systems fail

1211
01:44:19,666 --> 01:44:21,541
and everybody becomes core-ized.

1212
01:44:21,625 --> 01:44:25,250
That's the only way to turn things around.

1213
01:44:25,916 --> 01:44:27,458
Yeah, I understand.

1214
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:30,541
But, jeez, Gendoh sure is sly.

1215
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:33,958
Taking advantage of the anti-universe,
keeps doing quantum teleportation.

1216
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:37,291
Catching him ain't gonna be easy.

1217
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:41,250
It's okay, Ms. Mari. I'll go now.

1218
01:44:42,166 --> 01:44:45,333
Puppy Boy,
there's a chance the Princess' soul

1219
01:44:45,416 --> 01:44:47,750
might be left over inside Unit 13.

1220
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:50,583
So please, the Princess...
Asuka needs your help.

1221
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,666
I got it.

1222
01:44:53,916 --> 01:44:55,333
Ayanami...

1223
01:45:02,083 --> 01:45:06,166
I will come for you,
no matter where you are.

1224
01:45:06,958 --> 01:45:09,000
You wait for me, Shinji!

1225
01:45:09,625 --> 01:45:11,625
Okay, thank you.

1226
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:13,666
I'll wait for you.

1227
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:19,208
Good luck.

1228
01:45:19,583 --> 01:45:21,500
Are you fine with this, Rei?

1229
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:23,791
Ayanami...

1230
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:26,458
Shinji...

1231
01:45:27,041 --> 01:45:28,125
I'm sorry.

1232
01:45:28,625 --> 01:45:32,791
I tried so that you wouldn't have
to pilot an Eva anymore, but I failed.

1233
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,708
It's okay. Thank you, Ayanami.

1234
01:45:36,541 --> 01:45:37,541
I'll take it from here.

1235
01:45:38,416 --> 01:45:40,041
Yes, please.

1236
01:45:47,166 --> 01:45:49,750
So, Unit 01's pilot has awakened, has he?

1237
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:52,791
Transmission from
the anti-universe via Unit 08i.

1238
01:45:52,875 --> 01:45:54,541
Eva Unit 01 has reactivated!

1239
01:45:54,625 --> 01:45:56,291
No way! It can't be!

1240
01:45:56,375 --> 01:45:59,208
The jinx's synch rate was zero!

1241
01:45:59,291 --> 01:46:02,541
Could it be that Shinji's
true synchronization wasn't zero,

1242
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:04,916
but the closest value to zero?

1243
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,916
Yes, his synch rate is

1244
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,208
infinite.

1245
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:24,875
It transformed into Cassius,
the spear of hope.

1246
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:31,041
Please, you've got to stop this, Father!

1247
01:46:32,125 --> 01:46:34,583
No, I cannot.

1248
01:46:35,291 --> 01:46:37,791
I have deeds to fulfill.

1249
01:46:46,833 --> 01:46:51,416
What does that man plan to do
by forcefully causing Another Impact?

1250
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:54,708
There can be only one reason
for causing Another Impact.

1251
01:46:54,791 --> 01:46:57,166
<span style="s0">He created a new spear 
for the Fourth Impact, </span>

1252
01:46:57,250 --> 01:47:00,166
<span style="s0">but then he reserved two spears 
until the very end. </span>

1253
01:47:00,833 --> 01:47:03,541
Probably to realize one single wish.

1254
01:47:04,166 --> 01:47:06,583
That's so stupid. What a selfish jerk.

1255
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,250
We'll be reunited soon, Yui.

1256
01:47:12,375 --> 01:47:13,458
I can't move.

1257
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:16,208
Father, let me go!

1258
01:47:19,791 --> 01:47:21,208
What is that?

1259
01:47:21,291 --> 01:47:22,875
That is the Golgotha Object.

1260
01:47:22,958 --> 01:47:25,625
Beings who were not human

1261
01:47:25,708 --> 01:47:30,875
left behind in this place six spears,
the Adams, and the world of the Gods.

1262
01:47:30,958 --> 01:47:34,666
My wife, your mother, was here as well.

1263
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:38,541
This is the promised land,
the place where everything started.

1264
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:41,375
There are things man cannot change,
except here.

1265
01:47:41,458 --> 01:47:45,375
This is the one and only place
even fate may be bent to one's will.

1266
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,916
Where are we?

1267
01:47:55,125 --> 01:47:56,416
The Eva cage?

1268
01:47:57,916 --> 01:47:58,916
What is this place?

1269
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,166
This is the world of your memories.

1270
01:48:01,666 --> 01:48:02,666
Father?

1271
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:07,166
Our senses can't perceive
the anti-universe.

1272
01:48:07,791 --> 01:48:12,666
Therefore, the LCL has created
a virtual environment we can perceive.

1273
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,541
Hand over Unit 01 without delay.

1274
01:48:16,166 --> 01:48:19,875
Then you too will be able
to meet your mother again.

1275
01:48:30,291 --> 01:48:32,500
So you intend to put up
a futile resistance?

1276
01:48:33,125 --> 01:48:35,000
This is why I dislike children.

1277
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:52,916
Fine, we'll take the long way, then.

1278
01:50:41,125 --> 01:50:43,833
What's going on?! Our moves are the same.

1279
01:50:45,166 --> 01:50:46,333
This is hard!

1280
01:50:46,416 --> 01:50:48,750
The two Evas are perfect counterparts.

1281
01:50:48,833 --> 01:50:52,625
Unit 01 embodies hope. Unit 13, despair.

1282
01:50:53,208 --> 01:50:56,083
They are synchronized
and attuned to each other.

1283
01:50:56,583 --> 01:50:59,333
This also
is a rite of passage I must pass.

1284
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:02,208
Please stop, Father!

1285
01:51:05,708 --> 01:51:07,000
It's useless.

1286
01:51:07,083 --> 01:51:11,125
Your feeble powers will not stop me.

1287
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:38,500
You still don't understand.

1288
01:51:48,458 --> 01:51:50,416
Your powers are meaningless.

1289
01:51:55,083 --> 01:51:57,500
Violence and fear are not the criteria

1290
01:51:57,583 --> 01:52:00,500
upon which our conflict can be resolved.

1291
01:52:24,416 --> 01:52:28,375
That's right. This is not something
that can be resolved through might.

1292
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,916
I want to talk to you, Father.

1293
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,916
Father...

1294
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:38,625
what are you trying to do here?

1295
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:42,375
Something that can only be done
here at the Golgotha Object.

1296
01:52:42,458 --> 01:52:44,125
The Additional Impact.

1297
01:52:44,875 --> 01:52:48,583
That paves the way through which
I may slay the Gods.

1298
01:52:49,541 --> 01:52:54,083
To that end,
I delivered two spears upon this land.

1299
01:52:55,166 --> 01:52:57,791
MAGI Copy predicts that 

1300
01:52:57,875 --> 01:53:01,541
<span style="s0">Commander Ikari will exhaust 
the last two spears at the very end. </span>

1301
01:53:01,625 --> 01:53:06,541
Once all the spears are gone, Shinji
won't be able to stop the initiation.

1302
01:53:06,625 --> 01:53:07,833
Then what the hell do we do?

1303
01:53:07,916 --> 01:53:11,750
We'll make a new spear
and deliver it to him.

1304
01:53:11,833 --> 01:53:14,875
That's impossible.
Just how do you plan to do that?

1305
01:53:14,958 --> 01:53:17,500
<span style="s0">While this ship was hijacked 
and reverted to the Buße,</span>

1306
01:53:17,583 --> 01:53:21,875
<span style="s0">the ships used the Black Moon as 
raw material to create unknown spears. </span>

1307
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:26,458
<span style="s0">So there must be a way 
this ship can create a new spear. </span>

1308
01:53:27,083 --> 01:53:30,333
When human will imbues with Wunder,
it could work another miracle.

1309
01:53:30,416 --> 01:53:35,125
I believe in Ritsuko's intelligence
and the power of WILLE and Wunder.

1310
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:38,416
That's reckless.
We only have the data samples

1311
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:39,958
we collected a moment ago.

1312
01:53:40,041 --> 01:53:41,458
I bet that's enough for you.

1313
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:45,458
I suppose. I'll give it a shot.

1314
01:53:46,166 --> 01:53:48,416
I think the key's
in the spinal linkage system.

1315
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:51,708
Sorry, Maya,
we'll have to do this on the fly.

1316
01:53:51,791 --> 01:53:53,875
No problem, XO senpai.

1317
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,583
That's what we always do.

1318
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:58,791
Chief! Backup power systems

1319
01:53:58,875 --> 01:54:01,375
and spinal linkage system
still good to go!

1320
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:04,250
Let's swap out the components right here!

1321
01:54:04,833 --> 01:54:09,291
No! You need to evacuate!
Just being here is dangerous!

1322
01:54:09,375 --> 01:54:10,958
It's our last duty!

1323
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:12,583
Let's do what we can, Chief!

1324
01:54:14,041 --> 01:54:16,583
This is the problem with young men.

1325
01:54:16,666 --> 01:54:21,583
Right. Let's start aiding Shinji before
Commander Ikari does something crazy.

1326
01:54:21,666 --> 01:54:22,666
Yes, ma'am!

1327
01:54:22,750 --> 01:54:27,125
Unit 01 pilot,
there's something I want to show you.

1328
01:54:31,416 --> 01:54:32,833
That's...

1329
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:34,583
Black Lilith?

1330
01:54:34,666 --> 01:54:37,416
I see.
Your memory leads you to see it as such.

1331
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:40,208
This is Evangelion Imaginary.

1332
01:54:40,291 --> 01:54:43,875
Doctor Katsuragi predicted
the existence of this Eva.

1333
01:54:43,958 --> 01:54:46,666
An Eva that is imaginary and fictional.

1334
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:50,208
Only humanity, with its ability
to believe equally

1335
01:54:50,291 --> 01:54:52,250
in both fantasy and reality,
can perceive it.

1336
01:54:55,333 --> 01:54:59,875
The spears of despair and hope become
each other's sacrifice and trigger.

1337
01:54:59,958 --> 01:55:02,250
The Imaginary and Reality blend together,

1338
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:05,291
and everything becomes
homogenized information.

1339
01:55:10,833 --> 01:55:13,125
And thus begins the Additional Impact.

1340
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:16,250
The process
that rewrites not only our cognition,

1341
01:55:16,333 --> 01:55:18,125
but the entire world as well.

1342
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:31,625
This is the only means
by which my wish can be granted.

1343
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,375
This is the Additional Impact?

1344
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,625
Yes, that's probably Eva Imaginary.

1345
01:56:00,708 --> 01:56:02,541
I never thought it really existed.

1346
01:56:03,166 --> 01:56:04,625
This is crazy.

1347
01:56:08,708 --> 01:56:09,833
It's totally nuts!!

1348
01:56:57,083 --> 01:56:59,958
I see, so it finally begins.

1349
01:57:01,958 --> 01:57:03,416
Oh, it's you.

1350
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:06,208
It's been quite some time,
Professor Fuyutsuki.

1351
01:57:06,875 --> 01:57:11,291
But I gotta say, isn't the L-containment
field density pretty damn high here?

1352
01:57:11,375 --> 01:57:16,541
Well, this ship was never designed to
be manned. I realize I'm being reckless.

1353
01:57:17,416 --> 01:57:21,166
The ray of light called hope
eternally shines upon humanity.

1354
01:57:21,708 --> 01:57:26,333
But humans also drown, clinging on
to the disease known as hope.

1355
01:57:26,833 --> 01:57:30,833
I believe both Ikari and I have clung
on to that disease for far too long.

1356
01:57:31,458 --> 01:57:36,958
Gendoh wants to fulfill his wish by being
the focal point of human instrumentality.

1357
01:57:37,583 --> 01:57:40,166
I can sympathize with how
you want to help him,

1358
01:57:40,250 --> 01:57:43,833
or actually,
how your wish overlaps with his.

1359
01:57:44,333 --> 01:57:48,375
But I'd rather you not drag the whole
of humanity down with you, ya know.

1360
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,958
I can understand. My job is done.

1361
01:57:52,583 --> 01:57:56,208
I've assembled the things you wanted.
Do as you see best fit,

1362
01:57:56,916 --> 01:57:59,041
Mary Iscariot.

1363
01:58:00,916 --> 01:58:03,833
Wow, it's been forever
since someone called me by that name.

1364
01:58:04,916 --> 01:58:07,958
Righty-oh. Bye-bye.

1365
01:58:15,541 --> 01:58:16,708
Yui.

1366
01:58:18,166 --> 01:58:19,375
Is this what you wanted?

1367
01:58:53,416 --> 01:58:55,833
We've gotten it loose! It'll work now!

1368
01:58:55,916 --> 01:58:58,458
Captain,
the crew we have here will be enough.

1369
01:58:59,166 --> 01:59:01,333
Roger. All hands, abandon ship.

1370
01:59:03,166 --> 01:59:06,416
<span style="s0">All hands, abandon ship! 
I repeat. All hands, abandon ship! </span>

1371
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:09,916
<span style="s0">Priority One to wounded personnel! 
Head to the escape pods now! </span>

1372
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:17,291
All of the Adams' Vessels,
the Opfer Type Evas,

1373
01:59:17,375 --> 01:59:18,666
are right here, I see.

1374
01:59:20,083 --> 01:59:23,000
As always, Professor Fuyutsuki
sure runs a tight ship!!

1375
01:59:25,208 --> 01:59:29,208
Sorry, but you guys
gotta be the sacrificial lambs...

1376
01:59:33,666 --> 01:59:35,333
for my Eva's overlapping!

1377
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:43,333
Now, we're at 08 plus 09 plus 10.

1378
01:59:55,833 --> 01:59:57,666
Plus 11!

1379
02:00:05,375 --> 02:00:07,708
Alright, just...

1380
02:00:07,791 --> 02:00:09,541
one more to go!

1381
02:00:10,166 --> 02:00:12,291
Escape pods 1 through 4, hatches closed. 

1382
02:00:12,375 --> 02:00:15,250
<span style="s0">Any remaining crew, rush 
to Escape Pod 5 immediately! </span>

1383
02:00:17,916 --> 02:00:20,083
I need to go back to the helm.

1384
02:00:20,166 --> 02:00:22,791
Our job now is to survive.

1385
02:00:23,916 --> 02:00:25,416
No matter how bitter it feels.

1386
02:00:31,583 --> 02:00:35,875
<span style="s0">Captain, the swapping out is done. 
I think we can give it a go now. </span>

1387
02:00:35,958 --> 02:00:37,333
Roger.

1388
02:00:37,416 --> 02:00:40,125
Direct all helm control systems
to the Captain's seat.

1389
02:00:40,208 --> 02:00:41,875
Then leave the ship right away.

1390
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:43,416
Misato?

1391
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:45,000
Someone has to stay behind 

1392
02:00:45,083 --> 02:00:46,708
<span style="s0">and make absolutely sure 
activation starts. </span>

1393
02:00:46,791 --> 02:00:49,750
And I have final responsibility
over this ship.

1394
02:00:50,791 --> 02:00:55,416
<span style="s0">Ritsuko, look after the survivors... 
all the children left behind. </span>

1395
02:00:57,875 --> 02:00:59,666
I understand, Misato.

1396
02:01:00,375 --> 02:01:01,833
I'll do my best.

1397
02:01:02,833 --> 02:01:04,250
Thank you.

1398
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,916
We're low on EM power reserves.
When all else fails...

1399
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,833
legacy reaction propulsion engines...

1400
02:01:33,416 --> 02:01:35,291
are the way to go, I guess.

1401
02:02:07,833 --> 02:02:10,208
The Lilin won't be needing you anymore.

1402
02:02:10,833 --> 02:02:13,083
Rest in peace, Adams.

1403
02:02:14,166 --> 02:02:17,458
The Wunder is on the move.
I gotta join up with them.

1404
02:02:18,041 --> 02:02:21,875
But, oh, boy... Attempt to realize
the instrumentality of both humanity's

1405
02:02:21,958 --> 02:02:25,458
physical and mental being simultaneously?

1406
02:02:25,541 --> 02:02:28,208
So, Gendoh, what...

1407
02:02:28,833 --> 02:02:31,291
Father, what do you wish for?

1408
02:02:31,375 --> 02:02:36,125
I chose a world that you refused.
A world where there are no A.T. Fields,

1409
02:02:36,208 --> 02:02:40,083
where humanity shares
one heart and mind equally.

1410
02:02:40,708 --> 02:02:42,750
There are no barriers between individuals,

1411
02:02:42,833 --> 02:02:47,500
no rich nor poor, no discrimination,
no wars, no abuse, no pain nor sorrow.

1412
02:02:47,583 --> 02:02:50,208
A world of only pure, unsoiled souls.

1413
02:02:50,291 --> 02:02:55,875
And it is a restful world
where I can be with Yui once more.

1414
02:02:56,583 --> 02:02:58,500
Yui! Yui! 

1415
02:02:59,125 --> 02:03:01,916
Yui! Yui! Yui!! 

1416
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,375
Yui! Where are you?! Where are you, Yui?! 

1417
02:03:06,458 --> 02:03:10,500
<span style="s0">Everybody here... is Rei?! 
Where! Where are you?! </span>

1418
02:03:10,583 --> 02:03:12,083
Yui!! 

1419
02:03:12,541 --> 02:03:15,333
Father, you have to stop this.

1420
02:03:15,958 --> 02:03:18,833
Why?! What are you doing here, Shinji?!

1421
02:03:19,625 --> 02:03:21,416
I want to learn about you.

1422
02:03:22,458 --> 02:03:27,041
I stayed away from you
even when I was lonely.

1423
02:03:27,708 --> 02:03:31,291
Because I was afraid I'd finally
find out if you disliked me or not.

1424
02:03:32,416 --> 02:03:35,125
But I want to know now.

1425
02:03:35,208 --> 02:03:36,250
To know you, Father.

1426
02:03:40,875 --> 02:03:45,000
An A.T. Field?
But I got rid of my humanity!

1427
02:03:47,083 --> 02:03:50,333
Could it be that I'm afraid of Shinji?

1428
02:03:50,958 --> 02:03:52,458
Me?

1429
02:03:52,958 --> 02:03:56,250
This wasn't something to get rid of.

1430
02:03:56,958 --> 02:04:00,166
It was something
to be returned to you, Father.

1431
02:04:06,791 --> 02:04:09,208
So you were just like me.

1432
02:04:09,875 --> 02:04:11,375
Yes, I was.

1433
02:04:12,250 --> 02:04:15,666
Headphones cut me off
from the outside world.

1434
02:04:16,708 --> 02:04:21,541
They protected me from the noise of
others, helped me feign indifference.

1435
02:04:23,125 --> 02:04:27,916
<span style="s0">But when I met Yui, 
I no longer needed them. </span>

1436
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:31,833
Have you decided on a name? 

1437
02:04:31,916 --> 02:04:35,250
Shinji if it's a boy. Rei if it's a girl. 

1438
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,666
Shinji... Rei... 

1439
02:04:46,916 --> 02:04:50,208
<span style="s0">I never knew my parents' love, 
and yet I became a parent. </span>

1440
02:04:50,833 --> 02:04:54,708
<span style="s0">There is no question this world 
is unstable, imperfect and irrational. </span>

1441
02:04:55,333 --> 02:04:59,625
<span style="s0">It is a world where things break down 
if you take what people say at face value. </span>

1442
02:04:59,708 --> 02:05:02,416
<span style="s0">People say different things 
at different times. </span>

1443
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:07,875
<span style="s0">Which is the truth? 
What am I supposed to go along with? </span>

1444
02:05:07,958 --> 02:05:09,416
Maybe both were the truth to them. 

1445
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:13,666
<span style="s0">The difference was due to what was 
going through their minds at the time. </span>

1446
02:05:14,583 --> 02:05:17,458
I feared forming bonds with people. 

1447
02:05:18,125 --> 02:05:20,041
I disliked a world brimming with them. 

1448
02:05:20,875 --> 02:05:23,333
I was alone since my childhood. 

1449
02:05:23,416 --> 02:05:26,000
So I never felt lonely. 

1450
02:05:26,708 --> 02:05:30,375
<span style="s0">But there are those in society 
that scorn such an existence. </span>

1451
02:05:31,125 --> 02:05:33,416
I hated going to other people's houses. 

1452
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:37,250
<span style="s0">Having to visit classmates that didn't 
interest me, or relatives at their home. </span>

1453
02:05:37,333 --> 02:05:41,958
<span style="s0">Forced to confront the circumstances of 
their lives and made to partake in them. </span>

1454
02:05:42,791 --> 02:05:45,208
<span style="s0">Being together with others 
was excruciating. </span>

1455
02:05:45,291 --> 02:05:47,625
I just wanted to be alone, always. 

1456
02:05:48,666 --> 02:05:52,250
There were two things I liked as a child. 

1457
02:05:52,333 --> 02:05:53,500
One was knowledge. 

1458
02:05:54,166 --> 02:05:59,125
<span style="s0">I could satiate my starving heart 
by gorging on information on my own terms. </span>

1459
02:05:59,208 --> 02:06:00,958
No need to think about others. 

1460
02:06:01,583 --> 02:06:06,375
<span style="s0">I could serve upon myself as much 
knowledge as time would allow me. </span>

1461
02:06:07,208 --> 02:06:09,125
The other was the piano. 

1462
02:06:09,208 --> 02:06:13,333
<span style="s0">A finely tuned wire would respond 
accurately to the key that was touched. </span>

1463
02:06:15,666 --> 02:06:19,208
<span style="s0">There is no deception there. 
No betrayals. No disappointments. </span>

1464
02:06:19,291 --> 02:06:23,208
<span style="s0">My existence would be seamlessly 
translated into a flow of sounds. </span>

1465
02:06:23,291 --> 02:06:25,458
I liked this system. 

1466
02:06:25,958 --> 02:06:27,208
I liked being alone. 

1467
02:06:27,875 --> 02:06:30,916
<span style="s0">Neither I nor anyone else 
would get hurt that way. </span>

1468
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,708
Alone, I could be at ease. 

1469
02:06:34,833 --> 02:06:36,500
But after encountering Yui, 

1470
02:06:36,583 --> 02:06:40,750
<span style="s0">I learned that living could be 
an enjoyable experience. </span>

1471
02:06:41,291 --> 02:06:45,541
Yui alone accepted me for who I was. 

1472
02:06:48,625 --> 02:06:50,458
After I lost her, 

1473
02:06:50,541 --> 02:06:55,041
<span style="s0">I was afraid 
I could not live alone anymore. </span>

1474
02:06:56,291 --> 02:06:58,708
<span style="s0">For the first time, 
I felt the anguish of loneliness. </span>

1475
02:07:00,291 --> 02:07:01,750
"HUMAN INSTRUMENTALITY PROJECT
PRELIMINARY DRAFT"

1476
02:07:01,833 --> 02:07:03,750
I could not bear the burden of losing Yui. 

1477
02:07:05,375 --> 02:07:08,625
I just wanted to cry in her arms. 

1478
02:07:09,875 --> 02:07:14,250
<span style="s0">I just wanted to change myself 
by being at her side. </span>

1479
02:07:15,583 --> 02:07:19,125
I just wanted to make that wish come true. 

1480
02:07:20,375 --> 02:07:23,958
Am I... Am I forbidden to meet Yui

1481
02:07:24,583 --> 02:07:26,208
because I am weak?

1482
02:07:27,625 --> 02:07:29,000
Shinji...

1483
02:07:29,791 --> 02:07:32,458
I think it's because you don't want
to accept your weakness.

1484
02:07:34,541 --> 02:07:37,958
You knew all along, didn't you, Father?

1485
02:07:41,166 --> 02:07:42,583
What?

1486
02:07:42,666 --> 02:07:44,291
I think that's Ms. Misato.

1487
02:07:57,958 --> 02:07:59,375
I'm not through yet!

1488
02:08:20,666 --> 02:08:24,875
Impossible...
All the holy spears have been lost.

1489
02:08:25,625 --> 02:08:28,875
There should be no new spears left
that could rewrite the world!!

1490
02:08:28,958 --> 02:08:31,750
<span style="s0">The Gods bestowed upon us Cassius, 
the spear of hope, </span>

1491
02:08:31,833 --> 02:08:33,375
and Longinus, the spear of despair. 

1492
02:08:34,041 --> 02:08:37,125
But even after losing those two spears,

1493
02:08:37,208 --> 02:08:40,791
the will to return the world to how
things were created the spear Gaius.

1494
02:08:40,875 --> 02:08:42,666
No, the WILLE's spear.

1495
02:08:43,583 --> 02:08:46,166
Armed with knowledge and willpower, 

1496
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:48,625
<span style="s0">humanity has made it this far 
even without divine help... </span>

1497
02:08:49,333 --> 02:08:50,458
Ms. Yui!

1498
02:09:05,458 --> 02:09:06,625
Made it through!

1499
02:09:12,041 --> 02:09:13,250
Mari, go to Shinji!

1500
02:09:13,333 --> 02:09:14,583
You got it!

1501
02:09:14,666 --> 02:09:16,416
I'll bring him back! Promise! 

1502
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:17,916
Counting on you!

1503
02:09:38,708 --> 02:09:43,083
<span style="s0">It seems a new spear will arrive 
before I could be reunited with Yui. </span>

1504
02:09:44,208 --> 02:09:45,208
How regrettable.

1505
02:09:48,833 --> 02:09:52,208
As your mother, this was the only thing
I could do for you.

1506
02:09:52,291 --> 02:09:54,625
I'm sorry, Ryoji. 

1507
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:08,625
Thank you, Ms. Misato.

1508
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:12,541
You can heed what others think
and accept their deaths?

1509
02:10:13,166 --> 02:10:15,708
You've grown to be an adult, Shinji.

1510
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:20,916
Until the very end, I wasn't sure 

1511
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,958
if Shinji was needed 

1512
02:10:24,750 --> 02:10:26,500
to rebuild Yui. 

1513
02:10:27,416 --> 02:10:30,625
Fulfilling a wish entails a sacrifice. 

1514
02:10:31,333 --> 02:10:34,083
<span style="s0">I thought a child 
was a punishment upon myself. </span>

1515
02:10:34,916 --> 02:10:36,625
Not meeting my child, 

1516
02:10:36,708 --> 02:10:40,791
<span style="s0">not being there for him, 
I thought that would be redemption. </span>

1517
02:10:41,833 --> 02:10:45,791
I believed that would be best for my son. 

1518
02:11:07,625 --> 02:11:09,250
I'm sorry... 

1519
02:11:09,875 --> 02:11:10,958
Shinji. 

1520
02:11:12,416 --> 02:11:13,541
I see... 

1521
02:11:14,708 --> 02:11:16,041
So that's where you were...

1522
02:11:16,791 --> 02:11:18,166
Yui... 

1523
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:32,125
Gendoh Ikari...

1524
02:11:32,208 --> 02:11:36,291
He was at the center of the circle,
the core of human instrumentality.

1525
02:11:36,375 --> 02:11:37,916
I'll take over now.

1526
02:11:38,625 --> 02:11:39,666
So, Shinji Ikari,

1527
02:11:39,750 --> 02:11:41,791
what do you wish for?

1528
02:11:41,875 --> 02:11:45,208
I'm fine. I think I can handle
pain and heartbreak.

1529
02:11:45,916 --> 02:11:48,708
I'm more worried about
saving Asuka and the others.

1530
02:11:50,291 --> 02:11:51,750
I see.

1531
02:11:51,833 --> 02:11:55,083
You've already been able
to stand back up in the real world,

1532
02:11:55,166 --> 02:11:57,000
not just in the imaginary one.

1533
02:11:59,166 --> 02:12:03,291
I've got to settle the score
for what my father did. Asuka.

1534
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:08,625
<span style="s0">I don't know Daddy... 
Mommy isn't around... </span>

1535
02:12:09,458 --> 02:12:10,875
That's why...

1536
02:12:11,208 --> 02:12:13,416
You don't need anyone, Asuka.

1537
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:18,416
I'm gonna make it so. 

1538
02:12:20,041 --> 02:12:21,541
Or it'd be too painful. 

1539
02:12:23,166 --> 02:12:25,083
Living is painful. 

1540
02:12:30,833 --> 02:12:32,333
So I pilot my Eva. 

1541
02:12:54,041 --> 02:12:56,083
People might hate me or diss me. 

1542
02:12:56,166 --> 02:12:57,375
It doesn't matter, 

1543
02:12:57,458 --> 02:12:59,500
as long as I can pilot my Eva. 

1544
02:13:00,125 --> 02:13:01,875
After all, that's all I'm worth. 

1545
02:13:03,958 --> 02:13:08,166
<span style="s0">I'll make my body and heart strong 
so I don't need anyone. </span>

1546
02:13:08,250 --> 02:13:09,250
So... 

1547
02:13:09,833 --> 02:13:11,000
praise me. 

1548
02:13:11,666 --> 02:13:12,875
Recognize me. 

1549
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:15,500
Give me a place where I can be. 

1550
02:13:16,791 --> 02:13:18,000
I'm actually lonely. 

1551
02:13:26,583 --> 02:13:28,041
I just want... 

1552
02:13:28,958 --> 02:13:31,041
someone to pat me on my head. 

1553
02:13:44,458 --> 02:13:45,541
It's okay.

1554
02:13:46,041 --> 02:13:48,875
You're who you are. That's fine.

1555
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,958
I was asleep?

1556
02:14:02,875 --> 02:14:03,916
Idiot Shinji?

1557
02:14:04,583 --> 02:14:06,666
I'm glad I could see you again.

1558
02:14:07,625 --> 02:14:09,333
I wanted to say something to you.

1559
02:14:10,416 --> 02:14:13,250
Thanks for saying you liked me.

1560
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:17,166
I liked you too.

1561
02:14:22,291 --> 02:14:23,875
Goodbye, Asuka.

1562
02:14:24,083 --> 02:14:25,166
Give my regards to Kensuke.

1563
02:14:25,250 --> 02:14:27,083
Take care of yourself, Princess...

1564
02:14:34,166 --> 02:14:35,625
Guess she's gone.

1565
02:14:35,708 --> 02:14:37,666
Won't you be lonely, Shinji?

1566
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:39,875
No, I'll be fine.

1567
02:14:40,416 --> 02:14:41,666
Now it's your turn...

1568
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:42,916
Kaworu.

1569
02:14:44,666 --> 02:14:45,666
I now remember...

1570
02:14:46,250 --> 02:14:49,500
I've been here before many times
and met you.

1571
02:14:49,583 --> 02:14:53,833
Our names are listed in the Book of Life.
We'll keep on meeting each other.

1572
02:14:54,625 --> 02:14:57,666
I'm you. I'm just like you.

1573
02:14:58,291 --> 02:14:59,875
That's why I was attracted to you.

1574
02:15:00,666 --> 02:15:02,500
I wanted to give you happiness.

1575
02:15:03,166 --> 02:15:04,166
Yes.

1576
02:15:04,750 --> 02:15:07,125
Kaworu, you're just like my father.

1577
02:15:07,208 --> 02:15:09,458
That's why you piloted an Eva, isn't it?

1578
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:12,750
Shinji,
you're different from your usual self.

1579
02:15:13,458 --> 02:15:14,875
You're not going to cry?

1580
02:15:14,958 --> 02:15:15,958
No.

1581
02:15:16,708 --> 02:15:18,750
Crying is just a relief for yourself.

1582
02:15:19,541 --> 02:15:22,500
Me crying won't save anyone.

1583
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:26,125
That's why I won't cry anymore.

1584
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:29,416
I see... You have grown, haven't you?

1585
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:32,166
I'll miss how you were before,
but this is fine too.

1586
02:15:32,833 --> 02:15:38,041
Kaworu, I think I have to get rid
of your Eva, Unit 13 too.

1587
02:15:38,666 --> 02:15:41,333
Right. You're casting aside the Evas...

1588
02:15:42,083 --> 02:15:45,708
I'm sorry. I misunderstood your happiness.

1589
02:15:46,416 --> 02:15:50,541
Exactly, sir. That was your happiness,
Commander Nagisa.

1590
02:15:51,583 --> 02:15:53,666
<span style="s0">It wasn't Shinji's happiness 
that you wanted. </span>

1591
02:15:54,583 --> 02:15:58,000
<span style="s0">You wanted his happiness 
to make you happy. </span>

1592
02:16:00,458 --> 02:16:03,500
<span style="s0">The only thing that can end 
my existence is vacuum decay. </span>

1593
02:16:03,583 --> 02:16:07,583
<span style="s0">That's why I have to 
repeatedly play a role </span>

1594
02:16:07,666 --> 02:16:10,958
<span style="s0">in this predestined circular narrative 
for all of eternity. </span>

1595
02:16:22,375 --> 02:16:24,166
This is what you do to bond.

1596
02:16:28,458 --> 02:16:33,458
You seek a world with complementaries.
Shinji, you never change.

1597
02:16:34,083 --> 02:16:39,000
That's exactly why you chose him
and listed his name in the Book of Life.

1598
02:16:39,083 --> 02:16:41,958
Thank you. You gave me salvation, Ryoji.

1599
02:16:42,041 --> 02:16:44,375
I'm honored, Commander Nagisa.

1600
02:16:44,458 --> 02:16:48,125
Oh, c'mon, Ryoji. Call me Kaworu.

1601
02:16:49,166 --> 02:16:51,708
Not yet, Commander Nagisa.

1602
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:55,333
Nagisa means "shore,"
the space between land and sea.

1603
02:16:55,416 --> 02:16:59,000
It's a fitting name for you,
as the one that interlinks humanity,

1604
02:16:59,083 --> 02:17:02,291
the 1st Angel and that
which becomes the 13th Angel.

1605
02:17:03,208 --> 02:17:05,625
You've fulfilled your role
more than enough.

1606
02:17:05,708 --> 02:17:08,833
Let's let him take over from here.

1607
02:17:12,666 --> 02:17:16,833
How about working the earth
with me and Katsuragi once you retire?

1608
02:17:18,916 --> 02:17:23,291
Yeah. That sounds nice.

1609
02:17:28,666 --> 02:17:30,250
You're the only one left...

1610
02:17:31,166 --> 02:17:32,625
Ayanami.

1611
02:17:33,166 --> 02:17:34,500
I'm fine here.

1612
02:17:34,583 --> 02:17:38,500
Another one of you found a place
she could call home.

1613
02:17:39,166 --> 02:17:42,750
<span style="s0">I'm sure Asuka will be able 
to find her own new place as well. </span>

1614
02:17:43,541 --> 02:17:45,250
A happiness without an Eva. 

1615
02:17:45,875 --> 02:17:48,250
That's what I wished for you, Shinji. 

1616
02:17:48,333 --> 02:17:49,333
Yes. 

1617
02:17:50,083 --> 02:17:53,458
<span style="s0">So there's a life away from here 
that you can live too. </span>

1618
02:17:54,375 --> 02:17:56,208
-Really?
-Yes.

1619
02:17:56,791 --> 02:18:00,250
I'm going to choose a life
without Evas as well.

1620
02:18:01,166 --> 02:18:03,166
I won't rewind time or revert the world.

1621
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:07,833
I'm just going to rewrite the world
into one that doesn't have Evas.

1622
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:11,500
A new world where people can live.

1623
02:18:12,541 --> 02:18:16,666
Birth of a new world. Neon genesis.

1624
02:18:16,750 --> 02:18:17,750
Yeah.

1625
02:18:18,666 --> 02:18:21,375
And besides, Ms. Mari will come for me.

1626
02:18:21,458 --> 02:18:23,208
So don't worry.

1627
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,250
Okay. I won't.

1628
02:18:27,791 --> 02:18:30,541
Shinji, thank you.

1629
02:18:36,083 --> 02:18:38,333
I'll do it, Ayanami.

1630
02:18:39,208 --> 02:18:40,791
Neon genesis.

1631
02:18:56,083 --> 02:19:02,041
Even having to leave wounded friends 

1632
02:19:02,958 --> 02:19:06,250
You're capable of making 

1633
02:19:06,333 --> 02:19:09,958
A tough choice as a soldier 

1634
02:19:10,125 --> 02:19:11,583
Who is it?

1635
02:19:11,666 --> 02:19:15,291
The pain you are hiding 

1636
02:19:15,375 --> 02:19:17,500
<span style="s0">- Ayanami?
- I want you to share </span>

1637
02:19:17,583 --> 02:19:22,000
- No, it isn't. I see now.
- At least to me before you go

1638
02:19:22,083 --> 02:19:23,416
This is the reason why,

1639
02:19:24,583 --> 02:19:26,583
you were inside me all this time.

1640
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:28,916
Mother...

1641
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:32,333
I'll never forget, the lonely one 

1642
02:19:32,416 --> 02:19:35,541
Having to live with remorse because... 

1643
02:19:35,625 --> 02:19:36,833
I finally understand.

1644
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:42,208
Father wanted to see Mother go.

1645
02:19:42,291 --> 02:19:45,041

1681
02:23:24,208 --> 02:23:26,416
Sorry I'm late, Shinji!

1682
02:23:35,458 --> 02:23:38,375
The train will arrive shortly. 

1683
02:23:38,458 --> 02:23:43,250
<span style="s0">For your safety, 
please stand behind the yellow line. </span>

1684
02:24:06,791 --> 02:24:07,791
Who is it?

1685
02:24:08,708 --> 02:24:10,708
A gorgeous gal with big boobs.

1686
02:24:11,958 --> 02:24:13,166
Bingo.

1687
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:20,250
You smell real fine as usual.

1688
02:24:20,333 --> 02:24:22,166
The scent of an adult?

1689
02:24:25,916 --> 02:24:28,166
And you are real cute as usual.

1690
02:24:28,791 --> 02:24:32,416
Well, now.
You're talkin' like a real grown-up.

1691
02:24:38,375 --> 02:24:40,750
C'mon, Shinji!

1692
02:24:46,083 --> 02:24:47,458
Yeah, let's go!

1693
02:24:53,625 --> 02:24:57,916
<span style="s0">My first time at the Louvre was 
No big deal </span>

1694
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,208
<span style="s0">Because I'd already met 
My own Mona Lisa, long ago </span>

1695
02:25:02,291 --> 02:25:06,500
<span style="s0">The day I first laid eyes on you 
Wheels began to turn </span>

1696
02:25:06,583 --> 02:25:10,750
An unstoppable premonition of loss 

1697
02:25:10,833 --> 02:25:16,125
We already have so many 

1698
02:25:16,625 --> 02:25:20,125
But let's add another one 

1699
02:25:20,958 --> 02:25:25,125
(Can you give me one last kiss?) 

1700
02:25:25,208 --> 02:25:27,875
Something we don't want to forget 

1701
02:25:27,958 --> 02:25:33,750
Oh oh oh oh oh... 

1702
02:25:33,833 --> 02:25:36,458
Something I don't want to forget 

1703
02:25:36,541 --> 02:25:42,291
Oh oh oh oh oh... 

1704
02:25:42,375 --> 02:25:45,000
I love you more than you'll ever know 

1705
02:25:53,583 --> 02:25:55,375
"I don't like being photographed" 

1706
02:25:55,458 --> 02:25:57,791
But I don't need such things 

1707
02:25:57,875 --> 02:25:59,750
Your image is burnt forever 

1708
02:25:59,833 --> 02:26:02,000
On my heart's projector screen 

1709
02:26:02,083 --> 02:26:04,083
I was pretending I wasn't lonely 

1710
02:26:04,166 --> 02:26:06,250
Well, I guess that makes two of us 

1711
02:26:06,333 --> 02:26:08,291
Yearning for someone 

1712
02:26:08,375 --> 02:26:10,750
Came hand in hand with heartache 

1713
02:26:10,833 --> 02:26:15,916
Oh, can you give me one last kiss? 

1714
02:26:16,666 --> 02:26:20,166
A kiss as hot as fire 

1715
02:26:20,875 --> 02:26:25,166
So passionately that even if I wanted to 

1716
02:26:25,250 --> 02:26:27,875
I won't be able to forget it 

1717
02:26:27,958 --> 02:26:33,750
Oh oh oh oh oh... 

1718
02:26:33,833 --> 02:26:36,541
I love you more than you'll ever know 

1719
02:26:36,625 --> 02:26:42,333
Oh oh oh oh oh... 

1720
02:26:42,416 --> 02:26:45,416
I love you more than you'll ever know 

1721
02:27:03,833 --> 02:27:07,333
I already know 

1722
02:27:08,125 --> 02:27:11,666
Whether it's the end of the world 

1723
02:27:12,291 --> 02:27:17,250
Or I grow to be old 

1724
02:27:18,875 --> 02:27:21,500
There's someone I won't be able to forget

1725
02:27:21,583 --> 02:27:23,125
Oh oh oh oh oh... 

1726
02:27:23,208 --> 02:27:25,708
Someone I can't forget 

1727
02:27:30,166 --> 02:27:31,666
Oh oh oh oh oh... 

1728
02:27:33,875 --> 02:27:36,458
I love you more than you'll ever know 

1729
02:27:36,541 --> 02:27:42,375
Oh oh oh oh oh... 

1730
02:27:42,458 --> 02:27:44,958
Someone I can't forget 

1731
02:27:53,333 --> 02:27:56,833
Can't forget 

1732
02:27:57,458 --> 02:28:00,958
Can't forget 

1733
02:28:01,708 --> 02:28:05,208
Can't forget 

1734
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:09,791
Someone I can't forget 

1735
02:28:19,041 --> 02:28:25,000
Chasing after a breeze that blew by 

1736
02:28:25,083 --> 02:28:28,416
One dazzling afternoon 

1737
02:30:17,583 --> 02:30:23,041
If I could make just one wish 

1738
02:30:23,666 --> 02:30:25,875
Come true 

1739
02:30:25,958 --> 02:30:31,083
I want to be laid to rest next to you 

1740
02:30:31,166 --> 02:30:34,291
No matter where that may be 

1741
02:30:34,375 --> 02:30:37,833
Beautiful world 

1742
02:30:42,875 --> 02:30:46,625
Beautiful boy 

1743
02:30:51,291 --> 02:30:56,833
If I could make just one wish 

1744
02:30:57,333 --> 02:30:59,625
Come true 

1745
02:30:59,708 --> 02:31:04,625
I want to be laid to rest next to you 

1746
02:31:04,708 --> 02:31:08,125
No matter where that may be 

1747
02:31:08,208 --> 02:31:11,250
Beautiful world 

1748
02:31:11,333 --> 02:31:16,500
I only have eyes for you, no question 

1749
02:31:16,583 --> 02:31:19,625
Beautiful boy 

1750
02:31:19,708 --> 02:31:23,291
Yet unaware 

1751
02:31:23,375 --> 02:31:27,500
Of his own beauty 

1752
02:31:27,583 --> 02:31:31,625
It's only love 

1753
02:31:33,416 --> 02:31:37,500
Day in, day out 

1754
02:31:37,583 --> 02:31:41,625
Comic books and daydreams 

1755
02:31:42,333 --> 02:31:45,958
He doesn't like 

1756
02:31:46,041 --> 02:31:50,000
Who he is 

1757
02:31:50,083 --> 02:31:56,041
Not knowing what he wants 

1758
02:31:56,125 --> 02:31:58,958
Just wanting 

1759
02:31:59,041 --> 02:32:02,791
A lukewarm tear 

1760
02:32:02,875 --> 02:32:06,958
Runs down the cheek 

1761
02:32:07,041 --> 02:32:09,125
There isn't anything I want to say 

1762
02:32:09,208 --> 02:32:13,208
I just want to see you one more time 

1763
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:17,541
Maybe I'm a coward 

1764
02:32:17,625 --> 02:32:21,833
Who can't speak my mind 

1765
02:32:21,916 --> 02:32:23,958
Oh well, but... 

1766
02:32:24,041 --> 02:32:29,416
If I can't see you 

1767
02:32:29,916 --> 02:32:32,208
Before my world disappears 

1768
02:32:32,291 --> 02:32:37,333
Let me lay down to rest next to you 

1769
02:32:37,416 --> 02:32:40,583
I don't care where that may be 

1770
02:32:40,666 --> 02:32:43,791
Beautiful world 

1771
02:32:43,875 --> 02:32:49,208
In the days so fleeting 

1772
02:32:49,291 --> 02:32:52,291
Beautiful boy 

1773
02:32:52,375 --> 02:32:57,583
It's only natural to be temperamental 

1774
02:32:57,666 --> 02:33:00,166
Beautiful world 

1775
02:33:06,041 --> 02:33:08,583
Beautiful boy 

1776
02:33:08,666 --> 02:33:13,708
It's only love 

1777
02:33:14,416 --> 02:33:20,041
If I could make just one wish 

1778
02:33:20,541 --> 02:33:22,833
Come true 

1779
02:33:22,916 --> 02:33:28,875
I want to be laid to rest next to you 

1780
02:33:34,041 --> 02:33:38,041
It's only love 

1781
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:42,208
English lyrics translated by Hikaru Utada

The End
