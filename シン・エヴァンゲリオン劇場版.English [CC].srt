EVANGELION:1.11
YOU ARE (NOT) ALONE.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,375
[Ritsuko] Mankind's ultimate multipurpose
humanoid decisive weapon:

4
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,375
Artificial human Evangelion.

5
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,500
Shinji Ikari, you're the pilot.

6
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:14,750
[Gendoh]
Launch the <span>Eva.</span>

7
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,083
[Shinji]
There is no way I could!

8
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,333
[Gendoh] Stop wasting time.
Get in the <span>Eva </span> or get out!

9
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:23,250
[Shinji] Don't run away... Don't run away.
Don't run away!

10
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:24,916
I'll be the pilot.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,333
[Misato]
Our <span>Eva </span> can defeat an Angel.

12
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,208
[Gendoh] Our future depends on
defeating the Angels.

13
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:33,375
[Misato] 15 years ago, half of humanity
died in the Second Impact.

14
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,875
If the Angels set off a Third Impact,

15
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,375
humanity will die out.

16
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,000
[Shinji] What am I doing here?

17
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,125
[Rei] Don't you have faith in him?
In the work he does?

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,916
[Shinji] Piloting the <span>Eva </span> is all I have,
right?

19
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,416
It's the only reason Father sent for me.

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,000
That's why I have to be the pilot.

21
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,041
[Misato] You need to decide

22
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,708
if you want to be an <span>Eva </span> pilot.

23
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,833
[Shinji] I'll do it! I'll pilot my <span>Eva</span> .

24
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,250
[Rei] You won't die.
I will protect you.

25
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,666
[Misato] He didn't run
from piloting the <span>Eva</span> .

26
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,958
He should be left in charge

27
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,666
unless he wants out!

28
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,250
- [Tohji] Go get him!
- [Kensuku] I'm counting on you.

29
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,333
[Rei] Farewell. No, it's just that
I don't have anything else.

30
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,375
[Shinji] Ayanami!

31
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,875
[Rei] I don't know how
I should act at times like this.

32
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,708
[Shinji] Smile, that would be good.

33
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,916

YOU CAN (NOT) ADVANCE.

35

[Misato] Asuka Langley-Shikinami.

36
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,625
<span>Eva Unit 02</span> 's pilot.

37
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:18,625
[Asuka] You're an idiot!

38
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,833
[Shinji] Wow, I guess some people
like being an <span>Eva</span> pilot.

39
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,791
[Misato] So, you have issues
with your father?

40
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,583
- [Gendoh] Good work, Shinji!
- He congratulated me for the first time.

41
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,458
This Human Instrumentality Project...
What's NERV really up to?

42
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,833
[Kaji] Protect Katsuragi for me.

43
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,833
[Rei] I feel warm and fuzzy
when I'm with Shinji.

44
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,000
[Asuka] You're in love,
that's what it means!

45
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,416
[Mari] Makes you pretty interesting.

46
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,833
[Rei] You can be happy without one.

47
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,583
[Shinji] Father, Asuka's inside that <span>Eva</span> !

48
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,791
[Gendoh] That is an Angel!
Our enemy!

49
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,000
[Shinji] Arghh!

50
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,750
- It's all Father's fault!
- Running away again?

51
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,750
[Shinji] What's wrong with
running away from pain?

52
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,041
I never want to pilot an <span>Eva</span> again.

53
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,166
[Mari] Fretting over stuff like that
makes the life less fun.

54
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,541
[Rei] Just to make sure

55
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,666
that Shinji won't have to pilot
an <span>Eva</span> anymore!

56
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,083
I'm here because I'm Shinji Ikari,

57
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,583
pilot of <span>Evangelion Unit 1!</span>

58
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:01,708
Give me back Ayanami!

59
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,833
[Misato]
Do it to make your wish come true!

60
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,000
[Rei] Even if I'm gone,
others can replace me.

61
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,250
Ayanami! Come here!

62
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,833
[Rei] I'm sorry.
In the end, I couldn't do anything.

63
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,416
[Shinji] No need to be sorry. It's fine.

64
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,333
[Ritsuko] It's the continuation
of the Second Impact.

65
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,708
[Kaworu] The Third Impact is beginning!

66

-[Ritsuko] The time has come.

YOU CAN (NOT) REDO.

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,666
[Misato] Shinji Ikari, don't do anything.

69
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,250
[Shinji] Shouldn't I be piloting <span>Unit 1</span> ?

70
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,333
This is crazy, Misato!

71
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,791
How am I supposed
to take this in all of a sudden?

72
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,500
[Asuka] Because 14 years
have passed since then.

73
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,833
[Misato] We're WILLE, an organization
dedicated to the destruction of NERV!

74
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,541
I'm Kaworu Nagisa.

I'm like you, another child
with predetermined fate.

[Gendoh] <span>Evangelion Unit 13</span> .

77
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,458
When the time comes,
you are to pilot the <span>Eva </span> with him.

78
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,666
[Sakura] Don't pilot an <span>Eva </span> ever.

79
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,041
-[Misato] Rei doesn't exist anymore.
-[Shinji] You're lying!

80
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,875
[Kaworu] Once awakened,
<span>Eva Unit 1 </span> opened the Doors of Guf,

81
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,875
and acted as the trigger
to bring about the Third Impact.

82
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,833
You were the key to all of this.

83
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,625
-[Shinji] You're the one I saved, right?
-[Rei] I don't know.

84
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,000
[Gendoh] Let's begin, Fuyutsuki!

85
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,708
[Asuka] Idiot Shinji, do you want
to start another Third Impact?

86
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:07,166
[Shinji] I'll take those spears for you.
For everyone!

87
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,083
And then the world will turn to normal!

88
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,750
And even Misato will have to...

89
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,125
[Ritsuko] Misato, activate the DSS choker!

90
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:16,250
-[Kaworu] Don't do this, Shinji!
-[Asuka] Stop it, you stupid brat!

91
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,708
[Shinji] What the hell is this?

92
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,416
[Kaworu] The Fourth Impact.

93
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,583
This is its opening rite.

94
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,750
[Shinji] Is it my fault?

95
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,916
Because I pulled out the spears?

96
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,333
[Rei] These were my orders.

97
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,833
[Kaworu] Don't look so sad.

98
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,750
We'll meet again, Shinji.

Nothing good ever happens!

[Asuka] You're so naive.

102

[Kaworu] There are no sins
you can't atoned for.

[Ritsuko] Amazing line ahead formation.

148
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,833
They've formed a colony all on its own.
It's like a new creature now.

149
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,041
Mari, please intercept them.

150
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,541
Give us another 560 seconds.

151
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,583
You betcha!

152
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,125
I'll do the honors
of handling all those <span>44As</span> !

153
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,000
All right, Nagara, my gal,

154
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll leave you to handle my wire action!

155
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:45,083
Let's see now... Yaw, roll and pitch...

156
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,666
Oh! Whoa!

157
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,333
This setup is interesting,
but feels a bit awkward.

158
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,833
Wished they'd at least kept

159
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,208
humanoid points of articulation.

160
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,083
[Kitakami] <span>Unit 8</span> ,
currently engaging 1st wave of <span>44As</span> .

161
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,166
2nd wave detected.

162
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,833
As planned, all <span>44As</span>
are being drawn to <span>Unit-08</span> .

163
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,583
Available operational duration:
420 seconds.

164
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:24,083
Chief Boatswain, this is slow,
its like working on an 8-bit PC.

165
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,583
[Ibuki] Just like with the <span>Evas</span> ,
it's an enigmatic system

166
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,625
that humanity still does not
fully understand.

167
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,458
Control via human language isn't easy.

168
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,291
Stage 4: completed.
We're lagging behind quite a bit.

169
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,916
Keep calm and hurry it up.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am!

171
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,833
[Mari] Argh!

172
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,125
Yee-haw!

173
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,416
Maintain speed. Plus 20 on guide rig.
Keep current pitch.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,291
Steady as she goes!

175
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,125
You're not getting away!

176
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,583
[shouting]

177
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,416
- Yah!
- [clank and alarm]

178
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,500
[Mari] The 4th wave, huh?

179
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,041
One against many.

180
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,750
Many a small bird drive away a hawk, eh?

181
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,666
Operational time remaining: 360 seconds.

182
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,833
This is impossible!
I can't find a way to skip to Stage 5.

183
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,375
Anything can be done!
Keep going deeper!

184
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,500
It's impossible!
Not enough time to overwrite the data!

185
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,791
Nothing is impossible!
Add more bypasses!

186
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,833
Chief, there's not enough time!

187
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,250
Stop your whining!

188
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,291
This is why I hate young men.

189
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,208
[shouting]

190
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,083
Scurry off, you bums! Get out of here!

191
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,583
[Mari] Now that was a piece of cake!

192
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,666
[beeping and locator signal]

193
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,958
[Mari] So the mock angels
were using decoys, huh?

194
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,166
Cocky little punks!

195
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,875
Heads up: Boss Enemy!

196
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,583
[Ritsuko] An example
of a military application of <span>Evas</span> .

197
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,791
A clear violation of the Vatican Treaty!

198
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,541
What a combo to be up against!

199
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,750
A positron cannon armed <span>4444C</span>
land-battle variant

200
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,750
and power supply customized <span>44Bs</span> .

201
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,708
Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki
must be testing us.

202
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,500
[Kitakami] High energy readings
from the <span>44Bs </span> are increasing!

203
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
All stations: ready defensive measures!

204
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,291
All hands: brace for impact and EM blast.

205
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,125
[Kitakami]
<span>4444C </span> is now in firing position.

206
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,500
The <span>44Bs </span> are generating
a massive power surge.

207
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,708
Their energy is being routed
to the ultra-high voltage system!

208
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,250
All power supply systems
of <span>4444C </span> now active.

209
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,666
Positron acceleration
now in its final phase!

210
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,416
Its breech is now closed and locked!

211
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,458
Shout imminent!

212
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,416
[Mari] Just made it in the nick of time!

213
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,375
If it shoots again, we'll be hosed.

214
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,375
[Kitakami] High energy readings
from the <span>44Bs </span> once more.

215
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,208
It's storing energy
into the high-power emission system.

216
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:43,708
Already? <span>4444C</span> , acceleration initiated.
Assuming firing position!

217
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,000
We're really screwed!

218
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,458
Second shot imminent!

219
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,291
This is really, really bad!

220
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,125
[shouting]

221
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,625
Nagara, gal, give me a diversion!

222
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,833
[Nagara] Roger.

223
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,583
[Mari] Haaaaa-yaaa!

224
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,125
[coughing]

225
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,875
That won't stop me!

226
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,125
[in French] <span>Excusez-moi, Eiffel!</span>

227
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,708
[Kitakami] The <span>4444C</span>
is now completely silent.

228
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,791
Operational time left: 30 seconds!

229
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,916
- Using C for analysis.
- The final security lock is now disabled.

230
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,541
Anti-L System,
Stage 5 is now complete!

231
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,708
It's activating now, XO!

232
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,291
[Kitakami] Restoring the old Paris.

233
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,250
All Euro NERV facilities in hibernation
are now rebooting.

234
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,083
Systems coming back on line.

235
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,708
[sigh]

236
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,416
[weary sighs]

237
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,125
Very good work, Maya!

238
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,166
That was a really close call back there.

239
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,333
Assault successful.

240
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,625
Misato, please come collect the luggage.

241
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,291
[Misato] <span>Roger.</span>
<span>Now descending to the resupply point.</span>

242
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,375
[Aoba] <span>All hands: ready resupply.</span>

243
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,958
<span>Priority One on recovery of </span> Eva
<span>spare parts and munitions.</span>

244
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,875
[Hyûga] <span>Lower all logistics support ships.</span>

245
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,500
<span>Aircraft carriers go first. Hurry!</span>

246
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:02,291
[Ibuki] <span>Gather together all the parts</span>
Unit 2 <span>!

247
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,708
[Mari] The end crowns the work.

248
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:09,041
Now a cannibalized <span>Unit 2</span>
can be built anew.

249
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,125
Mari and <span>Unit 8 </span> can be modified

250
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,208
to be overlapping-compliant.

251
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,375
No matter where you are,

252
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,583
I'll come get you, doggy!

253
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:24,416
EVANGELION:3.0+1.01
THRICE UPON A TIME

254
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,250
[plodding orchestral music]

255
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,833
Tsk! What a weakling!

256
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,791
[Kensuke] Sorry, I'm late.

257
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,916
Are you OK, Ikari?

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,041
[gasps]

259
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,708
[friendly bark]

260
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,583
[Tohji] Hey, dogs aren't allowed in there!

261
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh, wow! Hey, there!

262
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,916
You're awake!

263
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,625
Recognize me?

264
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,083
It's me, boss! Tohji Suzuhara.

265
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,708
It's really been a while, Shinji.

266
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,125
I was blown away by the way you looked
when they brought you in here.

267
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,541
I know a little bit
about what happened to you,

268
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,208
but it's all so strange it's over my head.

269
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,916
I'm glad you're doing OK.

270
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,333
[soft grunts of pain]

271
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,750
So, can you get up now?
Well, it looks like it. Good!

272
00:16:58,833 --> 00:16:59,875
Let's get you up

273
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,416
and back to my place.

274
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,625
Here. It's a bit chilly out there.

275
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,541
[nurse] Doctor, the girl
doesn't want to change her clothes.

276
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,583
[Tohji] It's fine. Let her be.

277
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,833
[nurse] And sir, we're about
to run out of Tamiflu.

278
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,708
[Tohji] All right,
I'll talk to rations manager.

279
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,166
I'm sorry, but I'm going to call it a day.

280
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:18,833
All right, let's go.

281
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,083
This place is strange.

282
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,166
So many people are here!

283
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,541
[Tohji] Is this the first time
you've seen crowds?

284
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:48,583
This is Village 3, an enclave that houses
survivors from different places.

285
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,333
About 1000 people live here.

286
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,625
That's where food is rationed out,
three times a week.

287
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,875
Different stuff on different days.

288
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,291
Hello, Doctor!

289
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,750
Oh, Ms. Matsukata!

290
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,708
You're expecting.
Please, don't exert yourself.

291
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,500
[patient] Sir, are these the two Kredit
sent to you that you're looking after?

292
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,166
Yeah, it's something like that.

293
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:11,166
- Take care of yourself, won't you?
- Right! I'll be off then.

294
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,666
OK, bye!

295
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,583
What is "Kredit"?

296
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:19,458
[Tohji] Kredit is a welfare
support organization created by WILLE.

297
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,208
It not only provides goods,

298
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,541
but they also act as a go-between
for trade between other villages.

299
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,041
Our village here...
It's a far cry from being self-sufficient!

300
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,875
[Rei] What is that?

00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,250
[peels of hearty laughter]

454
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,000
[lady A] Good job!

455
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:11,708
We managed to meet
our daily target today as well.

456
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,333
Here. A special treat
for working hard on your first day.

457
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
What should I say at times like this?

458
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:20,791
Say thank you!

459
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,125
Thank you.

460
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,333
[lady A] Right,
let's have a nice bath now.

461
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,625
What is a bath?

462
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,541
MEMORIAL BATHHOUSE

463
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,500
This is a "bath".

464
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,958
[lady B] Dear, you can't bathe like that
with your clothes on.

465
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,875
Bathing is strange.

466
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:51,291
It makes me feel warm and fuzzy,

467
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,375
unlike being in LCL.

468
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:00,333
I'm alive even without orders. Why?

469
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,041
Rolling over in the corner,
all clammed up.

470
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,958
You're just putting on a show
to get sympathy.

471
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:11,458
You're in the way with my sweeping.
You moron!

472
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,500
[child] Oh, it's not Mommy.

473
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,708
[Hikari] Welcome home, Ms. Look-alike.

474
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,750
Thank you for the hard work.

475
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:23,083
[child's mother] Sorry I'm late.

476
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,666
[child] Mommy! Yay!

477
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:29,000
- Have you been a good girl?
- Weeee!

478
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,208
As always, thank you, Hikari.

479
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,958
Not at all. We're here to help each other.

480
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,916
- Right, let's go home.
- Yeah!

481
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,208
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

482
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,583
What is "goodbye", Hikari?

483
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:46,750
It's something we say
hoping we can see each other again.

484
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,750
Let's play together, Mommy!
Come on!

485
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,833
OK, OK, let's go now.

486
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,375
Why are they holding hands?

487
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,500
Well, it's something we do
hoping we can get along.

488
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,583
[gasp of surprise]

489
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,875
[Asuka] I'm sick of this!

490
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,708
[grunting in exasperation]

491
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:19,833
Hey, you're not the only one
that's hurting inside.

492
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,833
Puking again?

493
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:35,208
Damn brat! You should be grateful
you get fed in the first place!

494
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
You're still a mock Lilin.

495
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,666
You won't last if you don't eat.

496
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,166
Just swallow it down!

497
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,875
I've been living on water only.

498
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:45,583
Enjoy the taste of crappy food

499
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,708
before your body changes
and stops growing.

500
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:49,041
Idiot!

501
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:53,208
The only reason you don't do anything
is because you're afraid of getting hurt!

502
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,291
Since you got all this time to yourself,

503
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:58,166
why don't think about
why I tried to punch your face in before?

504
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,625
Man, you're so feeble
in that head of yours!

505
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:05,791
I'll bet you're wrapped up

506
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:09,250
in thinking about how everything you do
turns for the worse,

507
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,666
and it's all too late!

508
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,375
And you don't want to do anything
because you know it's all your fault.

509
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:18,125
Maybe you were just listening
to what your father told you to do.

510
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:21,291
But damn it!
You shouldn't have piloted any <span>Eva</span> !

511
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,083
You're such a wimp!

512
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,916
Go sulk all by yourself, loser!

513
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,833
[sad, slow piano music]

514
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,416
[penguin squawking]

515
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:01,166
[Kensuke] I'm home.

516
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,625
Hey, where's Ikari?

517
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,583
[Asuka] He ran away.

518
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:06,916
I see...

519
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,833
Leaving him alone might be
the best option.

520
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,166
Where did he go?

521
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,125
The lakeside ruins, north of here.

522
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,375
He chose a former NERV facility?

523
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:19,250
I guess there are ties you just can't cut.
What about rations?

524
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,166
I forced some down his throat.
He should last a while.

525
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,958
Thank you, Shikinami.

526
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,791
It's nothing. I didn't do it for his sake.

527
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:30,416
I'd never let him die selfishly
while he still had his head up his ass.

528
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,833
[crickets chirping]

529
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,250
You want to know my name?

530
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:49,500
Yeah, I mean we can't keep
on calling you Ms. Look-alike.

531
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:53,125
The doctor mentioned something
about how you forgot your own name.

532
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,791
So why don't you come up
with a new one on your own?

533
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,708
I can name myself?

534
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,625
[long, sad meow]

535
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,708
LIBRARY

536
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,333
Books...

537
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:21,291
Shinji mentioned these...

538
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,833
You dropped it, so I'm giving it back.

539
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:36,916
Thank you.

540
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,625
Wanna read?

541
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:40,625
"OCHIBI AND THE PORCUPINE"

542
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:41,708
Thank you.

543
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,041
[penguins squawking]

544
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,791
[Asuka] I'm alone.

545
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:58,083
Always have been, always will be.

546
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,208
That's just how it is, Asuka.

547
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,250
[movement outside]

548
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,791
Who's there?

549
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,250
[Rei] It's me.

550
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,500
Original Batch?

551
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,250
[Asuka] I'll unlock the door.

552
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,208
They told me Shinji would be here.

553
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:23,000
He's not here right now. He's run away.

554
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:25,291
I see. I'll go look for him then.

555
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,208
Let me tell you something.

556
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,250
Just like how it is with the <span>Evas</span> .

557
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,833
We <span>Eva</span> pilots have inhibitors

558
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:33,583
designed into us
so that we don't breech human limits.

559
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:36,333
Those inefficient emotions within you
are examples of that.

560
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,708
It's just a design scheme
based on human cognitive behavior.

561
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,541
You Ayanami Series have been adjusted

562
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,291
so that you will hold affection
toward the Third Boy.

563
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:47,625
The emotions you are feeling right now
have been rigged by NERV.

564
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:52,625
I see... It doesn't matter.
I'm OK with how I feel.

565
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,166
I see. Then you're on your own.

566
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,833
The object of your affection
is at N109 Tower,

567
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:01,166
inside the ruins
of the NERV 2nd Branch.

568
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,416
Thank you.

569
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,833
If you're going to see him,
then take some of those rations with you.

570
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,000
He should really be needing
them at this point.

571
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,833
Why aren't you in the village
with the others and working there?

572
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,208
What are you? Stupid?

573
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:14,375
This isn't a place
I'm supposed to live in.

574
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,958
It's a place I protect.

575
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:28,875
[Rei] Shinji.

576
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,916
I learned you should return things
someone dropped.

577
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:43,333
[footsteps approaching]

578
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:49,875
[gasp]

579
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,375
I'll come again.

580
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,625
[softly crying]

581
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,958
[long and gentle song by female vocalist]

582
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,500
About Shinji...

583
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,791
Is it OK to leave him alone?
Bad things might happen at this rate.

584
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:57,291
[Kensuke] Let's leave him be for now.
Ikari needs time to himself.

585
00:39:57,958 --> 00:40:02,333
But, Kensuke, aren't you being
a little insensitive towards him?

586
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:05,458
[Kensuke] Worrying about him too much
won't help any of us.

587
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:06,541
He'll come back.

588
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:08,583
Just believe in him.

589
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,041
I guess so.

590
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,666
I hope Shinji gets used to living
in the village sometime soon.

591
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,958
Shinji, why aren't you going
back to the village?

592
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:31,125
Shinji, you also aren't doing anything.

593
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,333
Are you protecting the village too?

594
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm not protecting anything.

595
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,250
I destroyed everything!

596
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:44,166
I don't wanna talk to anyone.

597
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,708
I don't want anyone to come here!

598
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,000
I just wanna be left alone!

599
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,000
[Shinji sobs]

600
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:55,125
But why is everyone so kind to me?

601
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,875
It's because we like you.

602
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,750
[sobs]

603
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,750
Thank you, for talking to me.

604
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:09,625
Let's do something
hoping we can get along.

605
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:18,041
[angry sobs]

606
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:29,250
Tired of running away?

607
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,666
Original Batch turned you around?

608
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,875
Did all that wailing about
help you get it out of your system?

609
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:38,958
Mhh...

610
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,708
Fine then...

611
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,041
If you can move around,

612
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,250
then make yourself useful
and help Ken-Ken.

613
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:58,166
[Kensuke] Let's hit the road a little.
It will take your mind off things.

614
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,083
I'm a handyman that does everything,

615
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:03,875
in return for being exempted from taking
part in the core industry of the village,

616
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,125
which is farm work.

617
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:08,250
Today, we're going to check
the infrastructure at the perimeter

618
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,458
and verify the environmental conditions

619
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:11,791
It'll be a busy day.

620
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:15,041
Much of the existing infrastructure
has exhausted its service life.

621
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:17,333
Since repairing it is very difficult,

622
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:18,875
we've left it alone.

623
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:32,375
[Kensuke] We only pick up sticks
that have fallen or prune the lower limbs.

624
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:34,708
We want to take good care
of the remaining forests.

625
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:42,750
Life at Village 3 is completely dependent
on the water here.

626
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:45,208
Checking the water flow is very important.

627
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:48,416
It's tied directly to the survival
of the village.

628
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,833
Water is the source of life, after all.

629
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,833
I'm going to check on the water source
further up.

630
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:57,208
The trek is a bit steep,
so stay behind and do some work.

631
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,750
Here, help secure some food for us.

632
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:04,166
No, I've never done it. I can't do it!

633
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,666
Try first, then talk. Don't sweat it.

634
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:14,208
Our quota is one fish per week.
There'll be another time to try.

635
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,333
That's WILLE's parting gift.

636
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:21,375
[Kensuke] It's a complementarity
L-containment field

637
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:24,500
purification process nullifying unit.

638
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:29,166
Village 3 has managed to avoid
core-ization thanks to it.

639
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,041
It's all thanks to Ms. Misato
and her group.

640
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:36,125
[distant rumbling]

641
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:38,416
[Kensuke] We started seeing
those things recently.

642
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,291
We call them Wanderers.

643
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:43,875
Headless <span>Evas</span> who were buried,
suddenly got up and started moving about.

644
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,875
We're here to observe them today.

645
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,833
Yeah, the containment pillars
are keeping them away.

646
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:53,541
I guess those seals are effective
against the Wanderers as well.

647
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,708
There are things a handyman can't do.

648
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,458
If the pillars stop working,
we're screwed.

649
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,000
As you can see,

650
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,333
we're not sure how much time
we have left.

651
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,458
But we're going to struggle on

652
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,125
and live until the very end.

653
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,958
[Hikari] Those are pickled plums.
We look forward to eating them every year.

654
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:21,000
Life is a continuous cycle
of tough times and good times.

655
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,458
There's nothing wrong with days
that feel like repetition.

656
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:25,541
I think that's how it is.

657
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,458
Right now is the youngest you'll ever be.

658
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,375
I want to live to the fullest
because I have Tsubame with me.

659
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,500
She's attached to you
more than she is to me.

660
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:40,500
You should live here with us from now on,
Ms. Look-alike.

661
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:43,875
My name?

662
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:46,375
Yeah, have you picked one yet?

663
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:48,666
No, not yet.

664
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,750
Then, why not have someone
decide it for you?

665
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:52,791
Give you a name?

666
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:55,958
Yes, I want you to give me a name.

667
00:44:57,375 --> 00:45:00,416
I want to stay here.
To do that, I need a name.

668
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:03,166
I want you to give me one.

669
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:05,166
A name for you?

670
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:08,333
But you're not Ayanami.

671
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,541
Any name will do.

672
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:13,875
I want to have a name that you give me.

673
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,041
[Asuka] Is Original Batch
functioning all right?

674
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:25,416
[Shinji] Yes, she was here today.
Why do you ask?

675
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:28,083
Nothing... no reason.

676
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:33,916
<span>Then, the big chestnut suddenly turned</span>
<span>around and ran away...</span>

677
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:48,333
[short rapid beeps]

678
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:49,500
[one long beep]

679
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:03,250
[Rei] I see...
I can only live inside NERV.

680
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:17,166
[Tohji] So, Shinji, have you gotten used
to living here?

681
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,291
- Uh-hmm. Yeah, a little.
- That's good to hear.

682
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,916
This is a village of people
from far and near,

683
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,750
all strangers to each other before.

684
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:27,000
But somehow
things are finally settling down.

685
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:28,916
[Shinji] Was it hard at the beginning?

686
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,666
[Tohji] Well, let's see...

687
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,625
A lot of stuff happened.

688
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,583
It wasn't a world
where kids without spines

689
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,916
could survive without changing fast.

690
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,125
We had to grow up in a hurry
and learn to do everything on our own.

691
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,916
I did things I'm ashamed of.

692
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,458
I did them for the sake
of my family, but still...

693
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:48,750
It was a world where you wouldn't play
nice if you wanted to survive.

694
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:51,750
I'm not really a doctor or anything
prestigious like that.

695
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:53,375
I'm just playing the part of one.

696
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:56,333
I learned on my own in order
to figure out how to help others.

697
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:57,666
I only make it by

698
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,750
thanks to the instruments and facilities
that Kredit provides us with.

699
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:04,458
You should be proud of yourself.
You're helping people, Tohji.

700
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:08,041
[Tohji] There are lives you can't save,
but I keep on going,

701
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,083
I think it's the doctor's role
to shoulder the sadness and anger

702
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,208
that come along with the losses.

703
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:14,625
I want to follow through

704
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:17,666
or make amends for the things
I'm responsible for doing.

705
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,166
That's the stuff that goes
through my head as I live on like this.

706
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:25,541
Shinji, you've already fought
a life's worth for us.

707
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:29,500
From now on,
you should stay here and live with us.

708
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:31,208
That's what I think.

709
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,958
[rooster crowing in the distance]

710
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:44,000
[Kensuke] Thanks for coming along with me
this early in the morning.

711
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:46,000
At the time, I never thought my father,

712
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:48,166
who survived the Near Third Impact,

713
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,375
would die just like that in an accident.

714
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:53,500
I should have had talks with him,

715
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:56,666
had some drinks,
and listened to some of his gripes.

716
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,750
Your father's still alive, right?

717
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,458
Even if you think it's a waste of time,

718
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,250
you should sit down
and have a good talk with him.

719
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:04,333
You'll regret it if you don't.

720
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:08,208
We're talking about Gendoh Ikari.
It's too tough for him.

721
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:13,208
[Tohji] Still, father and son...
The ties will always be there.

722
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,833
[crying baby]

723
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,000
[lady C] Ms. Matsukata
had a hard time during labor,

724
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:27,750
but she pulled through.

725
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:30,041
[lady A] Thank heavens
she gave birth without a hitch.

726
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:32,166
Her husband was crying with joy.

727
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:37,166
[female voice]
Village Background Announcement

728
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,333
[lady B] Ah, well,
you can smile after all!

729
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,375
[lady D] Yes, you're quite cute too.

730
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:44,083
[lady C] Except you wear
the same thing all the time.

731
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:46,083
Why don't you change
your clothes for once?

732
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,625
Yes. I'll try wearing something different.

733
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,333
[lady B] Say, why not try this next?

734
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:58,125
[lady A] Oh, yes, it looks great on you!

735
00:48:58,208 --> 00:48:59,250
[lady D] She is cute!

736
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,583
I'd love to have you
be my daughter-in-law.

737
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,416
[Rei] This is "blushing"?

738
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:05,166
That is so "cute"!

739
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:08,250
This is "embarrassed".

740
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:16,083
[Kensuke] Sorry, this suit's a bit hot,
but keep it on for a while.

741
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:21,041
I'm the jack-of-all-trades handyman,
but I also do liaison with Kredit.

742
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:29,083
The L-containment field is weaker here,

743
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,625
so Kredit has
an outdoor laboratory set up.

744
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:35,875
There is a staff member
that I want you to meet.

745
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,375
[boy] Mr. Aida!

746
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:47,125
It's been too long, sir.
I'm guessing this is your new assistant?

747
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:49,625
Yeah, something like that.

748
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,083
I've never met an outsider before.

749
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,583
I'm Kaji. Ryoji Kaji.

750
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:58,375
What's your name?

751
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,916
[Kensuke] So, what did you think?
Nice guy, isn't he?

752
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,833
[Shinji] Yes, he is.
But, his name... Kaji...

753
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:15,375
Yeah, he's Misato and Kaji's son.
He'll be 14 soon.

754
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:20,208
He knows nothing about his parents.
Ms. Misato wants to keep it that way.

755
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:23,250
She felt that she couldn't be
much of a mother to him,

756
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:26,500
so she decided she'll stay away
for the rest of her life

757
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:28,958
and instead protect him
as the head of WILLE.

758
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:32,625
[Shinji] Um, what happened to Mr. Kaji?

759
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,375
[Kensuke] He died.

760
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:38,583
Someone had to sacrifice themselves
in order to stop the Near Third Impact.

761
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:43,125
Mr. Kaji decided he'd be the one.
Ms. Misato let him as well.

762
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:47,916
Ms. Misato regrets how you got stuck
with all this baggage on your shoulders.

763
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,208
She felt she should've been the one.

764
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:54,666
I think she doesn't want to let you pilot
an <span>Eva</span> because of that.

765
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:59,041
Ikari, you're not the only one
who's hurting.

766
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,416
Ms. Misato is in pain as well.

767
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:15,875
The smell of earth...

768
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:19,333
Mr. Kaji...

769
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,083
[Kensuke] I've just been told <span>Wunder</span>
will come by tomorrow.

770
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:25,125
Your return route is all set up.

771
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:30,000
Here are the records of the village
that Ms. Misato asked for.

772
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:32,625
There are photos
of the family members of the WILLE crew.

773
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:35,500
And here's a letter
to Tohji's younger sister.

774
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:37,458
He asks kindly for your help.

775
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:39,833
Yeah, got it.

776
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,958
[Shinji] I'm home!

777
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,500
[Rei] These are "tears"?

778
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,625
I'm the one crying?

779
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,750
Is this how it feels to be lonely?

780
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,583
[Hikari] Good morning, Ms. Look-alike.

781
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:36,208
"Good night. Good morning. Thank you."

782
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:38,250
"Goodbye."

783
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:44,083
Good morning!

784
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:47,541
[Shinji] Good morning. What's up?
You're here early.

785
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,166
[Rei] I wanted to see you, Shinji.

786
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:54,375
Take this.

787
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,250
Thanks.

788
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,541
Thank you.

789
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:03,000
Um, about that name you asked about...

790
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:07,416
There's only one Ayanami.
I can't think of another name.

791
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:09,625
Thank you.

792
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:13,250
I'm glad you thought about my name.
I'm very grateful for that.

793
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:17,750
But I can't live here.

794
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:20,125
But, I like this place.

795
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:21,458
Ayanami?

796
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:25,666
Now that I know what "like" is,
I'm happy.

797
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,583
[increasingly rapid beeps]

798
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:30,875
Ayanami, what's wrong?

799
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:36,333
I wanted to harvest the rice.

800
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:43,708
I wanted to hold Tsubame more.

801
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,083
[gasp]

802
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:51,791
I wanted to be
with the boy I like... forever.

803
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,166
[worried gasp]

804
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:58,291
Goodbye.

805
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:01,500
Ayanami!

806
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:04,625
[Hikari] Really?
Ms. Look-alike isn't with you?

807
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:06,333
What's wrong?

808
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:16,791
[softly sobbing]

809
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:25,666
[helicopter noise and a whistle blowing]

810
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:34,958
[very loud vehicles]

811
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:42,000
[Kensuke]
So that's the <span>Wunder</span> , huh?

812
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:43,791
Jeez, it's huge!

813
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:48,000
Those must be the people
leaving the ship.

814
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:51,708
Guess the final battle
is right around the corner.

815
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,541
Hey, stop filming me!

816
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:59,375
[Kensuke] I'm sorry, but today,
I want to film it all.

817
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:02,916
Fine. Do as you please, then.

818
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,791
[friendly barking]

819
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,583
What are you doing here?

820
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:19,333
Ikari, you can stay behind, you know.

821
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:23,041
Thank you, Kensuke.

822
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:27,000
Please give my thanks to Tohji
and the others.

823
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:31,666
Asuka, I'll go with you.

824
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:35,416
OK. Well, these are the rules, so...

825
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,083
[bang and gasp]

826
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:43,750
Sakura...

827
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,458
Ms. Sakura Suzuhara?

828
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:52,791
I said don't pilot any more <span>Evas</span> ,
but you ran away and did just that!

829
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:57,500
You jerk! You absolute jerk!
You're such a jerk, Mr. Ikari!

830
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:58,666
[sobs]

831
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,916
What are you? His wife?

832
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:06,833
[Sakura cries in anger]

833
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:12,791
The status of the escapee
has been verified.

834
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:16,791
As of now, I will take over responsibility
of BM-03's monitoring and restrainment.

835
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:23,416
Please sign here, Temporary Special
Senior Major Langley-Shikinami.

836
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:26,416
No DSS choker?

837
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:30,000
[Sakura] There's no need.

838
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:31,916
He will be safeguarded

839
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,916
within the blast containment chamber
until the end of the mission.

840
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,708
[announcer] <span>Monitored Target Subject</span>
<span>BM-03 has arrived at Chamber 2.</span>

841
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:39,916
<span>Ready detonation systems.</span>

842
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,541
[Asuka] So this is considered
the most secure method for neutralization

843
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,750
since the choker was disabled so easily.

844
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,666
[Sakura]
MAGI-Copy has record of choker activation.

845
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:52,166
It seems its activation triggered
an explosion and death

846
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,166
that was witnessed by the other pilot.

847
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,166
[metal clanking]

848
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,625
Even after experiencing that trauma,
he still decided to return

849
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,083
to the <span>Wunder</span> .

850
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,166
Why?

851
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:02,791
[Asuka] Can't say.

852
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,500
Frankly, Captain Katsuragi granting him
permission to board

853
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:06,666
is more of a mystery to me.

854
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:08,958
The liaison handed me records

855
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:11,375
regarding Village 3 and personal
correspondence from Suzuhara.

856
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:13,083
From my big brother?

857
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,583
[emotional breath]

858
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,875
[announcer] <span>Chamber 2's total enclosure</span>

859
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,666
<span>and emergency blast activation system</span>
<span>is online.</span>

860
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,500
<span>The quarantine procedures</span>
<span>for Monitored Target Subject BM-03</span>

861
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:24,625
<span>is now complete.</span>

862
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,708
[crying]

863
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:32,458
We won't have any issue dealing
with supplementing the work assignments

864
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:34,583
left vacant by the departing crew.

865
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:37,333
Work on <span>New Unit 2</span> is proceeding smoothly,

866
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:39,833
Sit-rep on work on the main gun turrets
and ship's exterior?

867
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:44,250
[worker 1] Replacement of Turret 4
and aft turret is proceeding nominally.

868
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:46,416
[worker 2] Work on <span>Eva</span>
in the ships external dock

869
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,666
is lagging behind by a total of 3%.

870
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,166
[Ibuki] Speed is Priority One.

871
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,708
We're going to rush through
one-fifth of the checklist, got it?

872
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:53,791
Yes, ma'am!

873
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:56,750
[announcer] <span>N1 Rocket's secondary</span>
<span>coupling will restart in 5 minutes.</span>

874
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:59,083
[Kitakami] It's one thing
to have Major Shikinami rejoin us.

875
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,291
But why did that troublemaker
come along with her?

876
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:04,208
[Aoba] It's better than leaving him
in the wild

877
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,583
so NERV can take advantage of him.

878
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:08,083
[Tama] Unrestricted shoot-to-kill orders
have been issued to the crew

879
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:10,625
if he should attempt to pilot an <span>Eva</span> .
That's pretty reassuring.

880
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,291
[Kitakami] That's just talk, no substance.

881
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,208
I mean the Captain didn't neutralize him
when he last escaped.

882
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:18,791
At this point,
my faith in her has hit rock bottom.

883
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:21,541
We're talking about a child.
I understand her hesitation.

884
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:23,750
That "child" brought
about the Near Third Impact

885
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,208
and killed all members
of my family except me.

886
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:28,916
It was the consequence of his actions.
He didn't intend it.

887
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,583
Captain is fully devoted to making
atonement for what happened.

888
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:35,416
[Takao] I agree.
Kaji entrusted WILLE with her.

889
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,541
I feel I can trust her
until the ends of the Earth.

890
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:41,125
You are too soft on her
because you're close to her.

891
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,458
You just think she can redeem herself,

892
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:45,750
just like how someone's piss
could be purified

893
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:46,875
to become drinking water.

894
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,791
That's not how this works.

895
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,750
[announcer] <span>No problems detected</span>
<span>in tests for connecting JA parts</span>

896
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:58,125
New Unit 2 <span>.

897
00:58:58,208 --> 00:58:59,625
<span>Proceed as scheduled with work</span>

898
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:01,958
<span>on the independent coordination systems</span>
<span>of the left arm.</span>

899
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:03,541
They've added even more explosives.

900
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,583
It looks like they're losing faith in us.

901
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:09,416
I'm back.

902
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,916
Welcome back, Your Highness!

903
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,208
Great work out there.

904
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:17,541
Jeez, look at this place.

905
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:20,375
What happened to purging?
You've hoarded even more books.

906
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:22,666
Books are the aggregate
of human intellect.

907
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:25,583
My impossible dream is
to read every single book of all history

908
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,291
and from every corner of the world.

909
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:31,541
Any progress with doggy?

910
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:33,666
Who cares. Not interested.

911
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:37,583
Ah... So you're not interested
in cute boys at all?

912
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:40,791
That child doesn't need a lover.

913
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:42,333
He needs a mother.

914
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:45,166
[announcer] <span>All loading from logistic</span>
<span>support ships has been completed.</span>

915
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,458
<span>All logistics officers remaining</span>

916
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:50,375
<span>on support ships should vacate and return</span>
Wunder <span>immediately.

917
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:51,916
[Ritsuko] This is where you signed

918
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,875
to permit the operational independence
of Kredit

919
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,916
and removal of all restrictions
on the <span>Evas</span> ,

920
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,166
Captain Katsuragi.

921
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,625
[beep]

922
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:01,333
The document has been certified

923
01:00:01,416 --> 01:00:03,500
with the signatures
of the Captain and the XO.

924
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:04,875
Maya, please get started.

925
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:06,458
[Ibuki] <span>Roger, Senior XO.</span>

926
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:11,750
You're always here
when you want to be alone.

927
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:14,791
Maybe we should have this
be the captain's quarters?

928
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:18,500
I suppose it's hard to cut yourself off
from Ryoji, isn't it?

929
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:21,958
It's not about Kaji.
I can relax here. That's all.

930
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:24,333
[Ritsuko] Well, this section houses

931
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:26,083
the primary mission of this ship:

932
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:28,875
an ark serving to preserve
every single life form.

933
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,916
Its mission ensured
by an unmanned totally autonomous system

934
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,750
that can operate independently
for a near-perpetuity.

935
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:37,458
The <span>Wunder</span> 's true nature
is to be such an ark.

936
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:41,833
[Misato] For Kaji, the preservation
of humanity wasn't very important.

937
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:46,125
He held the highest priority
on preserving all the diverse life forms

938
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:49,958
that the Human Instrumentality Project
would obliterate.

939
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:54,916
He wanted to evacuate as many seeds
of life as possible outside of the Earth.

940
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:57,875
Aiming to realize this plan,

941
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:00,708
he seized this ship from NERV
while it was still being built.

942
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:05,666
He felt it was impossible for humanity
to stop the Instrumentality Project.

943
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:10,958
But in the end, he was able to stop
the Third Impact by sacrificing his life.

944
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:14,750
He killed himself, contradicting himself,
and being selfish all at once.

945
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,625
Super exasperating jerk!

946
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,666
But here we are without him.

947
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:29,083
As such, I am going to use this ship
to destroy NERV

948
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:31,583
and thwart
their Human Instrumentality Project.

949
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:33,250
[Ritsuko] So you can get revenge?

950
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:35,750
[Misato] No, instead of being an ark
that preserves life,

951
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:37,083
she will be a combat ship

952
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:38,333
that saves lives.

953
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:42,166
As words spoken by a mother,
they carry real legitimacy.

954
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:45,333
I have no right
to hold such qualification.

955
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:55,000
[Aoba] The Captain and the XO
are on the navigation bridge.

956
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:56,625
[announcer] <span>NERV HQ has started moving.</span>

957
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,791
<span>Accompanied by </span> The Black Moon
<span>that is standing erect,</span>

958
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:00,625
<span>it is believed to be moving</span>
<span>toward Ground Zero</span>

959
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:02,791
<span>in the former location of the South Pole.</span>

960
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:06,250
[thunderous noise and rumble]

961
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:19,625
[Fuyutsuki]
The restoration of <span>The Black Moon</span> ,

962
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,875
a precondition for the Fourth Impact
to take place...

963
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:26,000
The resurrection
of the Advanced Ayanami series,

964
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,625
untainted life forms
made with pure souls,

965
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,375
free of sexual distinction,

966
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:33,708
which shall become the sacrificial
offering to the <span>Vessel of the Adams</span> .

967
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:38,500
And the Human Instrumentality Project,
humanity's attempt of self-salvation.

968
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,833
All that arrogance leads to this, I see.

969
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:52,333
The Third Boy has returned to WILLE.

970
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:56,375
As Ayanami Number 6
was not properly calibrated,

971
01:02:56,458 --> 01:02:58,375
it seems to have lost its form.

972
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,916
Did you have your son to suffer

973
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,125
the same sense of loss you experienced
to teach him something,

974
01:03:04,583 --> 01:03:05,666
Ikari?

975
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:14,250
[Ritsuko] Well, he seems
to be psychologically stable.

976
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,291
So, Captain Katsuragi,

977
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:20,958
what are you going to do with the boy
provisionally named Shinji Ikari?

978
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:24,833
Never meet him again, just like your son?
You're sure he doesn't need to have a...

979
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:28,583
You're sure he doesn't need a DSS choker?

980
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:31,333
There is no point in redemption

981
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:33,875
unless there is a will to atone
for your sins.

982
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:37,583
Misato, I know
under that stoic façade of yours,

983
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:40,041
you are ecstatic about Shinji
returning to you.

984
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:44,875
Acting on sentimental emotions
only leads to deep trouble.

985
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:45,958
You know that first hand.

986
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:49,791
[Misato]
You don't pull punches, as always.

987
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:51,875
Letting you off the hook
leads me to deep trouble.

988
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:53,583
I know that first hand.

989
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:01,541
[Asuka] Hardly anything
with this body changes,

990
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:04,000
with the sole exception of my hair.
How annoying!

991
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:09,416
[Mari] Gods, corruption, and desires,
they dwell within the fibers of hair.

992
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:13,416
It's an apt representation
of the chaotic nature of mankind.

993
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,791
It's unequivocal proof
that you are a human,

994
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:17,250
Your Highness.

995
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,916
[crashing noise]

996
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:35,250
[Fuyutsuki] The cursed Ground Zero
of the Second Impact.

997
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,625
All the <span>Vessels of the Adams </span> are ready.

998
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:41,250
The reactivation of the <span>Unit 13</span>
is only a matter of time.

999
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:45,291
The reactivation of the <span>Unit 13</span>
is only a matter of time.

1000
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:49,166
[Gendoh] Right. Let us start, Fuyutsuki.

1001
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:52,791
Take care of the rest.

1002
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:53,958
[loud signal]

1003
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,666
[Fuyutsuki] So far, everything is going
according to SEELE's scenario.

1004
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:05,791
- [loud crash]
- Go on, Shinji!

1005
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:08,416
Do this for yourself!

1006
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:11,916
Do it to make your wish come true!

1007
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:19,666
[four buzzes]

1008
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,791
[Ritsuko calling]
<span>Captain, I have bad news.</span>

1009
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:24,250
<span>NERV HQ has arrived</span>
<span>at its final destination.</span>

1010
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:27,166
<span>We're detecting signs that</span>
Unit 13 <span> has started.

1011
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:31,125
So what you're telling me
is we are running short on time.

1012
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,125
[Ritsuko]
<span>Yes, but I have good news.</span>

1013
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:35,291
<span>The shutdown signal plug has been built.</span>

1014
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:38,208
<span>While at their bare minimum states,</span>
Eva <span> units are ready.

1015
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:41,083
Understood.
All stations: prepare for launch!

1016
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:44,041
[Misato] <span>Have all current work</span>
<span>end in 25 minutes.</span>

1017
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:45,666
<span>This ship gets underway in 30 minutes!</span>

1018
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,208
[Ritsuko] As usual,
you're asking for the impossible.

1019
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:50,750
All stations: prepare for launch
in battle stations condition 2!

1020
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:52,041
We disembark in 25 minutes.

1021
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:54,625
All hands: complete tasks
within 20 minutes.

1022
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:58,583
[announcer] <span>I repeat. All stations: ready</span>
<span>launch in battle station condition 1.</span>

1023
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:01,791
<span>Make final adjustments to position</span>
<span>the unmanned fleet at its launch position.</span>

1024
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,875
<span>N1 Rocket propellant injection complete.</span>

1025
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:06,291
<span>Switching to internal power.</span>

1026
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,541
<span>Final status check is a "go".</span>

1027
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:10,500
<span>All extravehicular work crew</span>
<span>must vacate</span>

1028
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:12,000
<span>immediately!</span>

1029
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:22,250
[Tama] You've got a bundle on your arm,
don't you, Chief Engineer Takao?

1030
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:26,083
Yeah, one for each comrade who died
when we rose against NERV.

1031
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:30,875
[Nagara] Those were the bandanas you
used to indicate you were a rebel, right?

1032
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:35,125
[Takao] Yeah, we want to return
the sea and the land back to this color.

1033
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:37,708
It's the symbol of our promise.

1034
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:40,541
Thank you.

1035
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:44,625
This bandana has become Ryoji's memento.

1036
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:06,291
[Kaji] Take care of yourself, Katsuragi!

1037
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:10,375
[Misato] Truth be told,

1038
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:13,750
I wanted to stay behind
with Kaji back then.

1039
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:16,208
[Ritsuko] I'm sure you did.

1040
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:17,958
If you weren't expecting,

1041
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:19,416
you might have been able to.

1042
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:25,291
I need to go to battle stations,
so I'll be at sickbay.

1043
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,250
Mr. Ikari, please don't go anywhere.

1044
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:31,083
Use the red button to call me,
if you need.

1045
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,333
I'll be on my way.

1046
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,916
[Mari] An extra deep-depth, pressure-
resistant, experimental plug suit.

1047
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:46,958
Seems it's brand spanking new.

1048
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:49,458
[Asuka] I'm sure it's a fresh batch
cut from virgin fabric.

1049
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:52,125
We're wearing these to our funeral.

[worker] <span>New Unit 2</span> , JA reactor activated.

1053
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,166
[Ibuki]
<span>No point testing decoupling systems.</span>

1054
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,125
<span>You're going for the real deal</span>
<span>from the very get-go!</span>

<span>Eva</span> units are currently being
positioned for launch.

1057
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:28,750
Four-Eyed Crony,
let's take a little detour.

Who is it?

1062
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,958
Um, I have no idea.

1063
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,458
I'll give you a hint.

1064
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:45,958
Rooftop and glasses...

1065
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:47,583
Big boobs...

1066
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,625
The parachute girl?

1067
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:51,041
Bingo!

1068
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:53,583
I should introduce myself.

1069
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:56,500
I'm Mari Illustrious-Makinami.

1070
01:08:57,083 --> 01:09:00,250
Nice to meet you again, WILLE Puppy.

1071
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:06,583
Huh, you've changed a bit.
I guess you're more grown up.

1072
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:09,916
Give me a break!
This brat doesn't change so easily.

1073
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:13,791
Since this is farewell,
I want to ask you something.

1074
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,208
[Asuka] Did you figure out
why I wanted to clobber you?

1075
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:23,083
It's because I couldn't make up my mind.

1076
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:28,791
When you were inside <span>Unit 3</span> ,
I didn't help you, and I didn't kill you.

1077
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,500
I did nothing to, escape responsibility.

1078
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,875
Well, I see you've matured a little.

1079
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:41,000
Since this is farewell,
let me tell you something.

1080
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:44,750
That boxed lunch you made for me,
it was pretty tasty.

1081
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:48,333
I think I had a crush on you back then.

1082
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:52,875
But I've grown into an adult ahead of you.

1083
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:55,333
So long.

1084
01:09:57,666 --> 01:09:59,083
You've done great.

1085
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:02,291
You should be proud of yourself,
Shinji Ikari.

1086
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:04,500
See ya!

1087
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:10,000
[Mari] Feeling better, Your Highness?

1088
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:12,875
[Asuka] Yeah, I'm fine.

1089
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,875
[announcer] Eva <span> pilots have begun

1090
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,708
<span>boarding their respective entry plugs.</span>

1091
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:22,666
Shinji, you need to find a place
to rest that you can call your own.

1092
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:26,875
The ties that bind you
will show you the way.

1093
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:29,375
We'll meet again.

1094
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:35,750
You're right, Kaworu.

1095
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,291
[Takao] APU power output stable.

1096
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:41,500
Main engine threshold achieved.

1097
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:44,166
Thrust increasing
to 11 million 600 thousand tons.

1098
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:46,083
[Nagara] Gyrocompass in operation.

1099
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:48,416
Helm and gravity controls: all green.

1100
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:51,250
Both <span>Evas </span> secured in launch position.

1101
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,333
Start entry sequence.

1102
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:55,708
Routing power to main guns.
No abnormalities in energy flow.

1103
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:58,875
Unmanned fleet
has been locked into position for launch.

1104
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:01,541
Suspend extravehicular work detail.

1105
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:02,916
Non-combatants: stand by!

1106
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,958
All stations are now
in battle stations condition 1.

1107
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:08,875
Captain, all stations ready for launch.

1108
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,708
We're now ready to storm NERV HQ.

1109
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:13,083
Roger.

1110
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,666
Captain to crew:

1111
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:18,750
In order to irreversibly prevent
the Fourth Impact from happening,

1112
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:21,041
this ship will now assault NERV HQ

1113
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,958
currently positioned
at the former South Pole Ground Zero.

1114
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:26,375
<span>Wunder</span>
will execute Operation Yamato,

1115
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:30,250
the neutralization of <span>Eva Unit 13</span> ,
which can trigger the Rites of Doom.

1116
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:32,833
We'll bring an end to all this chaos
once and for all.

1117
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:35,916
Now launch <span>Wunder!</span>

1118
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,333
[Ritsuko] Entry sequence complete.

1119
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:17,166
Command control has been transferred
to the battle bridge.

1120
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,833
[Kitakami] Reaching seed
storage units' ejection point.

1121
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:21,208
[Misato] Roger.

1122
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:23,583
Sever <span>Wunder</span> 's linkage to storage units.

1123
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:26,500
Make them switch to independent
internal power and control systems.

1124
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:29,500
Eject all seed storage units.

1125
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:02,416
[Aoba on intercom]
<span>All units ejected into L5.</span>

1126
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,708
<span>Autonomous systems functioning nominal.</span>

1127
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:10,000
Initiate descent to target. Begin reentry.

1128
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:12,500
[Nagara] Roger. Initiating reentry.

1129
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:31,083
[Aoba] Monitoring systems
are back on line.

1130
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:35,083
[Nagara] Proceeding to former South Pole
ground zero area.

1131
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:38,208
Making contact with L-containment
field barrier surface.

1132
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:50,125
Navigating L-containment
field barrier surface.

1133
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:51,208
All systems go.

1134
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:53,458
Above the L-containment field,

1135
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:56,000
an area that refuses
all life born of original sin.

1136
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:01,125
[Takao] Now humanity is advancing
through this purified area

1137
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,458
without being blessed.

1138
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:05,541
All thanks to the data Kaji retrieved
and the Anti-L systems.

1139
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:08,500
[Nagara] Two-zero to dive possible point
in the L-containment field.

1140
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:10,958
Roger. All stations: ready for dive.

1141
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:17,708
Starboard hull 2 hit! Damage unknown!

1142
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,541
Enemy ship sighted at 3 o'clock!

1143
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,833
[Ritsuko] Number 2 ship <span>Erlösung</span>
with Opfer Type systems!

1144
01:14:25,916 --> 01:14:27,958
So she was completed after all.

1145
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:29,500
I'm sorry,

1146
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:31,833
but I'm afraid you're going
to have to indulge Ikari

1147
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:33,666
with his games a bit more.

1148
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:39,541
They must be trying to buy time
to prevent the reactivation of <span>Unit 13</span> .

1149
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:42,375
That ship could also slay gods.
She won't be a pushover.

1150
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:43,750
Mano-a-mano sounds just fine.

1151
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:45,791
Starboard guns, ready to fire!

1152
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:48,875
We'll hold that NERV ship at bay
until we get to our diving point.

1153
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:50,166
Fire!

1154
01:15:08,541 --> 01:15:09,833
[screams of terror]

1155
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:14,125
We've taken multiple hits!
Their firepower is much greater!

1156
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:16,875
Shit. How can that ship be
the same class as ours?

1157
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:19,833
We're still incomplete,
while that ship was fully finished.

1158
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:22,375
Be that as it may,
our main engine is much better.

1159
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:31,458
[Nagara] We can now dive
into the L-containment field, Captain!

1160
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:33,250
- Emergency dive!
- Aye aye!

1161
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,125
Passing through first layer
of the L-containment field.

1162
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:51,875
Now entering second layer.

1163
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:54,458
L-containment field strength density
is plus three zero.

1164
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:57,000
Dead ahead 12 o'clock!
There's a swarm of <span>Eva</span> Infinities!

1165
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:59,250
No matter. We'll blitz right through them.

1166
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:07,791
Enemy vessel sighted
at our stern at 12 o'clock!

1167
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:08,791
It's an ambush!

1168
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:16,166
Number 3 ship, The <span>Erbsünde</span> !
We're between a rock and a hard place.

1169
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,750
[Tama] This is bad!

1170
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,041
Our navigation will fail
if we're hit anymore!

1171
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:27,291
Take out the No. 3 ship first.
She's incomplete.

1172
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:29,750
Helm steady. Maximum combat speed!

1173
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:31,458
[Nagara] Aye aye!

1174
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:35,791
[blending, screaming and screeching]

1175
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:44,458
[Fuyutsuki]
No. 3 ship is taking evasive action.

1176
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:47,833
Ram into her! Don't let her escape!

1177
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:57,791
[Kitakami] This is nuts!

1178
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:03,500
[Misato] Turn us around! Roll 180 degrees.

1179
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:05,458
Get them to take up our position.

1180
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:07,000
[Nagara] Aye aye.

1181
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:25,750
[Fuyutsuki] Using the No.3 ship
as a shield, I see.

1182
01:17:26,083 --> 01:17:28,583
Humph, she's as reckless as always.

1183
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,000
[Kitakami] We've broken through
the swarms of <span>Eva</span> Infinities.

1184
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:39,333
Now entering into the 3rd layer
of L-containment field.

1185
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:41,083
[Aoba] Acquired target: NERV HQ.

1186
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:43,750
It has traversed to a position
under <span>The Black Moon</span> .

1187
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:47,041
<span>Unit 13</span> 's reactivation is imminent.

1188
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:50,208
The No. 2 and No. 3 ships
are gaining on our aft.

1189
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,208
We're out of time.

1190
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:55,500
[Misato] Use <span>The Black Moon </span> as cover
and set course for assault on NERV HQ.

1191
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,500
Ready launch of guided munitions.

1192
01:17:57,583 --> 01:17:59,666
Set target to <span>Unit 13</span> ,
readjustment sector.

1193
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,041
NERV Battleships approaching

1194
01:18:01,125 --> 01:18:03,041
our aft at 6 o'clock!

1195
01:18:04,541 --> 01:18:07,458
Adjust <span>Wunder</span> 's altitude to minimize
areas vulnerable to enemy fire.

1196
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:09,083
Aye aye!

1197
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:12,250
Blow port gravity ballast, down two-zero.

1198
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:15,041
Priority One on safeguarding
our ships attached to the main wings.

1199
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:17,083
Concentrate our AT Field!

1200
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:27,708
Aft main gun hit! Heavy damage!
They're beating us to a pulp!

1201
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:31,166
Hold it together! Just make it
to the launch point in one piece.

1202
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:39,791
One-Zero until guided munitions
launch point.

1203
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:42,875
Trajectory clear!

1204
01:18:43,458 --> 01:18:44,708
Launch all guided munitions!

1205
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:47,166
Launching all guided munitions.

1206
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:54,208
[heroic music]

1207
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:12,458
[Aoba] We have visual confirmation
of our final target, <span>Unit 13 </span> !

1208
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:16,250
As we thought, it hasn't reactivated yet.
<span>Unit 13 </span> is still immobile.

1209
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:24,708
[Kitakami] <span>Eva 7 </span> series is inbound.
There are way too many of them!

1210
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:25,916
Systems can't keep up!

1211
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,875
Forget the cannon fodder.
Expedite launching of our two <span>Evas</span> !

1212
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:31,083
Maya, ready launch of 2 and <span>8.

1213
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,833
Roger. Readying launch of and <span>8.

1214
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:35,416
Launch them now!

1215
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:42,000
Mari, Asuka, I'm counting on you.

1216
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,166
Out of my way!

1217
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:08,083
Comin' through!

1218
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:19,208
Grrrrrrahhhh!

1219
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:30,625
Ahhhh! Comin' through!

1220
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:35,041
It's hit!

1221
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:37,125
Yargh!

1222
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,041
[shouting]

1223
01:20:40,416 --> 01:20:41,625
Yaaaa!

1224
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,791
Four-eyed Crony, give me my next piece!

1225
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:45,583
Here ya go!

1226
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:51,666
[yelling]

1227
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,166
Ah-ahr-argh!

1228
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:21,583
[yelling]

1229
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:22,791
Hah!

1230
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:30,708
[Mari] Princess!

1231
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:32,416
You!

1232
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:47,541
[Asuka] Mock <span>Evas</span> want to gang up
and stop us from getting through?

1233
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:49,250
Annoying shits!

1234
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:57,708
- Four-eyed Crony, lend me a hand!
- I gotcha!

1235
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:09,125
Grrrr!

1236
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:10,875
Nrrrrrrr!

1237
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:29,375
Both our <span>Evas </span> landed on NERV HQ!

1238
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:34,791
[Asuka]
Our target must be below that crater.

1239
01:22:56,458 --> 01:22:57,916
Damn it!

1240
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,333
You're such a pain in the ass!

1241
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:11,208
[Mari] Go ahead, Your Highness!

1242
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:13,958
[Asuka] I owe you one, Four-Eyed Crony.

1243
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,291
[Asuka] <span>Eva Unit 13.</span>

1244
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:40,833
We made it.

1245
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:49,541
Even if they call it "God's <span>Eva</span> ",

1246
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,583
that doesn't change the fact

1247
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:55,541
that it's the 13th multipurpose humanoid
defensive weapon built by man.

1248
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:01,416
Once the shutdown override signal plug
is inserted into the core,

1249
01:24:02,416 --> 01:24:05,541
we may not destroy it,
but it'll remain immobilized.

1250
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,333
This ends...

1251
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,625
Now!

1252
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:13,458
Yeeeeeeeeh!

1253
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:18,916
An AT Field?

1254
01:24:20,208 --> 01:24:22,791
<span>Unit 13</span> isn't supposed
to have an AT field.

1255
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:24,708
Why?

1256
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:28,375
Wait a minute,
is this my own <span>Eva</span> 's AT field?

1257
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:31,416
Is my afraid of <span>Unit 13 ?

1258
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:47,166
There is something wrong here.

1259
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,916
What are you scheming, Gendoh?

1260
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,500
This is weird.

1261
01:24:55,041 --> 01:24:58,208
The NERV battleships are pulling back.
They're descending.

1262
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,166
That's the cursed ground zero
of the Second Impact,

1263
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,250
the Calvary base!

1264
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,833
The Gates of Hell are open once more.

1265
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:20,916
Does this mean...

1266
01:25:25,916 --> 01:25:27,125
The Wings of Light?

1267
01:25:27,833 --> 01:25:30,125
Are they trying to start the Fourth Impact

1268
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,291
the way they did the Second Impact?

1269
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:36,500
No, ships built as the Guardians of Guf
shouldn't be able to become the trigger.

1270
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:40,333
Besides, what's happening
to <span>The Black Moon</span> isn't part of the plan.

1271
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:42,750
This isn't part of SEELE's scenario.

1272
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,916
This is a rite we know nothing about.

1273
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,041
A totally unpredicted Another Impact,
I see. This changes

1274
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,250
nothing.

1275
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:53,833
We will crush any
and all plans NERV intends to carry out!

1276
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:57,166
Ready our main guns.
Take out No. 3 ship first.

1277
01:25:57,541 --> 01:26:00,166
Every available gun: target No. 3 ship!

1278
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:02,666
[Misato] Ready Super EM
direct impact shells.

1279
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:04,833
Do not wait for calculations.

1280
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:06,291
All turrets: initiate fire.

1281
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:09,291
The construction plans specified
No. 4 ship as well.

1282
01:26:09,666 --> 01:26:11,083
[Misato] Fire!

1283
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,250
Sit-rep!

1284
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:16,416
Direct hit!

1285
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,083
Our starboard and port secondary hulls
have been impaled by something!

1286
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:21,708
Our stern has been damaged.
Main gun systems are now down!

1287
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:31,541
[Ritsuko] The No. 4 ship, <span>Gebet</span> .

1288
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:34,291
We've fallen into their trap.

1289
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:42,708
[Asuka] In either case, the final impact
is going to involve this <span>Eva.</span>

1290
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:45,208
We've got to take care
of this thing right now.

1291
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:49,166
It's right in front of me,
but I can't get through.

1292
01:26:49,916 --> 01:26:51,708
Time for the last resort.

1293
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:52,875
I'm sorry, <span>New Unit 2</span> .

1294
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,833
I have to make things rough for you.

1295
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:57,041
Disable all restrictors.

1296
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,333
Backdoor code: Triple Nine.

1297
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:20,791
Pattern blue!

1298
01:27:20,875 --> 01:27:23,000
I have readings of the 9th Angel
within NERV HQ!

1299
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:28,166
Princess! Are you going to use
the power of an angel?

1300
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:39,750
Ready Angel Blood.

1301
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:42,208
Full injection now!

1302
01:27:59,291 --> 01:28:02,375
[screams of pain, cracking noises]

1303
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:07,625
Help!

1304
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:09,708
[ferocious growl]

1305
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,291
Princess, you won't be human anymore!

1306
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:50,416
I'll neutralize the <span>New Unit 2</span> 's AT field

1307
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,458
using my own AT field!

1308
01:29:11,708 --> 01:29:13,958
[warrior scream]

1309
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:16,041
[ferocious roar]

1310
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:34,000
It's not a single entry plug system?

1311
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:47,750
Crap! Gendoh wanted Princess
to become an Angel!

1312
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:58,416
[weird self-contented laugh]

1313
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:01,458
[more laughter]

1314
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:03,791
[Asuka] Shikinami type?

1315
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,041
My original, huh.

1316
01:30:09,041 --> 01:30:11,250
[softer laughter]

1317
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:14,666
[original Asuka]
The last <span>Eva</span> 's form mirrors that of a god.

1318
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:17,750
All you need to do is accept me
along with my love.

1319
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:20,083
Come to me.

1320
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,291
[frightened gasp]

1321
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:24,958
Sorry, tough luck!

1322
01:30:30,875 --> 01:30:32,083
That's pointless, idiot.

1323
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,500
Asuka!

1324
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:58,750
All data links with the <span>New Unit 2s</span>
have been lost!

1325
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:00,041
Pilot status unknown.

1326
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,916
N2 reactor APU: heavy damage!

1327
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:06,750
Shit! What do we do now?

1328
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:11,791
It's something like an <span>Eva</span> !

1329
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:13,916
It's attached itself to the ship!

1330
01:31:16,958 --> 01:31:17,958
[Ritsuko] Pattern Blue.

1331
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:20,083
It must be an Opfer Type <span>Eva</span> .

1332
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:22,041
They built a Mk.9 and pilot from scratch?

1333
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,416
This is so bad!

1334
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,791
Our ship's being physically infiltrated!

1335
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:33,875
Expunge it now!

1336
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:38,208
We're trying. Contamination speed
is too fast, we can't keep up.

1337
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,458
[emergency beeps]

1338
01:31:43,041 --> 01:31:45,458
[Aoba] Mk.9 has broken through
the VD firewall!

1339
01:31:45,916 --> 01:31:48,625
We're screwed!
All control systems hijacked!

1340
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,416
Well, this is a real pickle to be in.

1341
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:06,541
As always,
Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki is impressive.

1342
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:23,708
[Fuyutsuki]
The artificial recreation of Lilith.

1343
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:27,125
The Forced conversion
of <span>The Black Moon </span> to become spears.

1344
01:32:28,041 --> 01:32:29,666
The stage is set.

1345
01:32:30,041 --> 01:32:32,125
How will you bring the drama to a close,

1346
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:33,166
Ikari?

1347
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:38,041
[Aoba] Confirming intruder
on the forward deck

1348
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:39,416
near the stern!

1349
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:41,375
Commander Ikari.

1350
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,500
I'm sorry, Princess.

1351
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:52,750
I'm filled with unbearable shame.

1352
01:32:53,375 --> 01:32:55,958
I guess I have to withdraw for the moment.

1353
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:07,083
[Misato] It's been some time...

1354
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,500
Commander Ikari.

1355
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:16,166
[Gendoh] I compliment you
on your hard work, Colonel Katsuragi.

1356
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:21,041
I shall now employ this ship
as previously planned.

1357
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:24,458
It's you!

1358
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:27,708
Shoot first, ask questions later, I see.

1359
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:31,375
As before, no hesitation to do anything
to accomplish the mission.

1360
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:34,375
Yes, I learned that
as being a virtue from you.

1361
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:49,000
[Gendoh] Gods need no barriers.

1362
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,083
We accept absolutely everything
that comes our way.

1363
01:33:53,958 --> 01:33:55,291
Gendoh Ikari,

1364
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,000
You used the Key of Nebuchadnezzar
and abandoned your humanity?

1365
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:02,125
I merely appended upon my body

1366
01:34:02,208 --> 01:34:05,125
information that lies
outside the logos of our realm.

1367
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:06,333
There are no problems.

1368
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:14,291
I'll slay the Gods,
bind them with humanity,

1369
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:18,625
and through the sacrifice of Angels,
enable the deification

1370
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:21,041
and fulfill the instrumentality
of humankind.

1371
01:34:21,416 --> 01:34:24,958
And you intend to sacrifice
Asuka to do this? Answer me Ikari!

1372
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:28,333
The Ayanami-and Shikinami-type pilots

1373
01:34:28,416 --> 01:34:31,083
were prepared specifically
for this moment.

1374
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,833
There are no problems.

1375
01:35:03,166 --> 01:35:04,166
[Misato] Humanity?

1376
01:35:05,041 --> 01:35:06,125
No.

1377
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,500
Ancient life of this planet
is being commoditized.

1378
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:14,500
All souls are converted to cores,
and merged with the <span>Eva</span> Infinities.

1379
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:17,416
Is this the start of the Fourth Impact?

1380
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:20,250
Correct.

1381
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:23,958
The Second Impact purified the oceans.

1382
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:26,166
The Third Impact purified the earth.

1383
01:35:27,125 --> 01:35:29,875
The Fourth shall purify the souls.

1384
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:35,041
The cores that form the <span>Eva</span> Infinities
are the materialization of souls.

1385
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:39,833
We'll cast aside our vessel,
the seeds of man,

1386
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:44,708
and our collective intelligence
will be guided to unsullied Paradise

1387
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:46,750
in this final rite.

1388
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:50,083
In exchange for bringing about
the Second Impact,

1389
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,958
your father, Dr. Katsuragi,
proved the validity of his proposal,

1390
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:56,166
the Human Instrumentality Project.

1391
01:35:57,166 --> 01:35:59,875
I will stop my father's raving gibberish
at all costs.

1392
01:36:00,625 --> 01:36:05,708
Having tasted the fruit of knowledge,
only two paths await humanity.

1393
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:09,708
Be exterminated by the Angels
that have eaten the fruit of life,

1394
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:13,333
or exterminate the Angels
and rob them of their seats before God,

1395
01:36:13,416 --> 01:36:14,791
surrender our intellect

1396
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:17,541
and become the divine offspring,
children of the Gods,

1397
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:19,625
and enjoy eternity existence.

1398
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:22,041
We must choose one of these two fates.

1399
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:24,541
NERV's Human Instrumentality Project

1400
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:26,791
was the product
of SEELE choosing the latter,

1401
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:30,750
a feeble resistance against the Gods
that employed the powers of Adam,

1402
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:33,500
nevertheless,
a worthwhile cause to pursue.

1403
01:36:34,291 --> 01:36:39,416
We will not choose for a reset of despair
that subjugates ourselves to the Gods,

1404
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,625
and instead choose
the continued option of hope.

1405
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:42,708
I have faith

1406
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:44,750
that humanity's will and knowledge

1407
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:47,458
will one day overcome
the power of the Gods.

1408
01:36:47,541 --> 01:36:50,958
[Gendoh] It's all a matter
of interpretation of the truth.

1409
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:53,791
Colonel Katsuragi,
you are forsaking the world.

1410
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:56,791
Doctor Akagi, you are blind
to what happiness has to offer.

1411
01:36:57,750 --> 01:37:00,291
Human sentiments cannot change anything.

1412
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:05,166
All the horsemen have assembled now.

1413
01:37:15,166 --> 01:37:19,041
So I will now have you return <span>Eva Unit 1</span>
that I lent to you.

1414
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,500
Father!

1415
01:38:33,833 --> 01:38:36,541
[Tohji] We all survived
the Near Third Impact.

1416
01:38:37,166 --> 01:38:40,375
I'm going to believe in our luck
and Ms. Misato's WILLE.

1417
01:38:44,291 --> 01:38:47,041
[Ritsuko] Beyond the Doors of Guf
is the anti-universe,

1418
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:49,125
a realm <span>Wunder </span> cannot enter.

1419
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:54,291
Sadly, WILLE no longer has the ability
to stop the Instrumentality Project.

1420
01:38:55,125 --> 01:38:56,833
We're at the end of our rope.

1421
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:58,750
Ms. Misato?

1422
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:02,416
I'll pilot <span>Eva Unit 1</span> .

1423
01:39:05,958 --> 01:39:07,083
[ferocious growl]

1424
01:39:07,166 --> 01:39:08,458
[yelling]

1425
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:25,333
[Shinji] On my way back home
after Ayanami disappeared,

1426
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:28,166
I noticed the smell of earth.
I learned that smell

1427
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:29,416
from Mr. Kaji.

1428
01:39:31,291 --> 01:39:34,208
Ms. Misato, I want to take
half the burden off of you.

1429
01:39:35,416 --> 01:39:39,166
Doing that means
you're going to fight Gendoh Ikari.

1430
01:39:43,875 --> 01:39:46,208
I want to settle this for myself.

1431
01:39:58,083 --> 01:39:59,333
Wait a second!

1432
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:01,500
Are you joking?

1433
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:04,125
You're not going to let him
pilot an <span>Eva</span> , are you?

1434
01:40:07,375 --> 01:40:09,166
I was afraid something like this
might happen.

1435
01:40:09,958 --> 01:40:14,166
You permitted us to shoot to kill
in situations like this, right Captain?

1436
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:16,000
You're a plague!

1437
01:40:16,791 --> 01:40:20,875
That <span>N3I</span> you started
made our lives a living hell!

1438
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:24,666
This is all the fault
of you and your father!

1439
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:27,416
I'll never forgive you two.

1440
01:40:32,458 --> 01:40:33,458
Sakura?

1441
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:36,000
Shinji Ikari won't pilot an <span>Eva</span> .

1442
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,125
Mr. Ikari piloted an <span>Eva</span>

1443
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:42,291
and brought misfortune on us
and upon himself!

1444
01:40:43,041 --> 01:40:45,583
That's why Mr. Ikari won't pilot

1445
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:46,875
an <span>Eva </span> !

1446
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,583
I'm sorry, Ms. Sakura.

1447
01:40:49,666 --> 01:40:51,041
Please, let me pilot the <span>Eva</span> .

1448
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:53,916
You're talking total hogwash, Mr. Ikari!

1449
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:56,958
Once you're hurt,
you won't have to worry about piloting.

1450
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:59,875
I know this will hurt, but it's
better than having to be the pilot.

1451
01:41:00,375 --> 01:41:01,458
Please forgive me!

1452
01:41:04,166 --> 01:41:05,291
Misato!

1453
01:41:05,375 --> 01:41:06,375
Captain!

1454
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,208
Misato!

1455
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,833
[Misato] It's OK, Shinji.

1456
01:41:11,958 --> 01:41:15,541
If you hadn't piloted <span> Eva Unit 1</span>
14 years ago,

1457
01:41:15,625 --> 01:41:18,166
we would have already been exterminated.

1458
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:20,833
That's why I'm grateful to you.

1459
01:41:20,916 --> 01:41:23,666
Even if <span>N3I </span> happened as a consequence.

1460
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:28,416
I am entirely responsible
for your actions.

1461
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:32,291
I, Misato Katsuragi, still has custody
of Shinji Ikari.

1462
01:41:32,666 --> 01:41:35,916
I'll take full responsibility
for his subsequent actions.

1463
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:41,750
Right now, I want to entrust
everything to Shinji.

1464
01:41:45,375 --> 01:41:50,833
That's right, we're all in debt
to Mr. Ikari for saving us!

1465
01:41:50,916 --> 01:41:52,750
But my father, and so many others,

1466
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:54,250
were lost to <span>N3I!</span>

1467
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:57,625
Mr. Ikari is our savior and our destroyer!

1468
01:41:57,708 --> 01:42:00,208
This is all too messed up,
but this is all we can do!

1469
01:42:02,666 --> 01:42:05,416
[Kitakami] It's all right.
Let it go, Sakura.

1470
01:42:06,708 --> 01:42:08,916
Let's just think about
what we do in the future.

1471
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:10,916
[crying]

1472
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,916
[Sakura] This is... all so...

1473
01:42:20,083 --> 01:42:21,541
[Mari] Sorry there, folks!

1474
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:26,583
Doing some prep work made me late.

1475
01:42:26,666 --> 01:42:27,666
Now let's go...

1476
01:42:28,166 --> 01:42:29,166
... doggy!

1477
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:34,625
[Ritsuko] Maya, get us the plug suit
that's stored in the Captain's quarters.

1478
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:42,166
The bullet will dissolve quickly.
I'll do first aid on you.

1479
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:44,500
It's OK, Second Lieutenant.

1480
01:42:46,125 --> 01:42:47,125
Shinji Ikari,

1481
01:42:48,708 --> 01:42:54,666
the only thing a son can do for his father
is pat him on his shoulder... or kill him.

1482
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:56,958
That's something Kaji used to say to me.

1483
01:42:58,416 --> 01:43:01,208
Ms. Misato, you should know
I met Ryoji Kaji.

1484
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:03,416
Was he well?

1485
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:04,916
Yes.

1486
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
[sigh]

1487
01:43:06,083 --> 01:43:07,166
That's good to hear.

1488
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:09,666
He was such a nice guy.

1489
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:13,291
I only talked to him for a short while,
but I liked him.

1490
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:15,541
Thank you.

1491
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:19,791
I'll back you up.

1492
01:43:20,375 --> 01:43:22,416
I'm counting on you, Shinji.

1493
01:43:23,791 --> 01:43:24,833
Yeah.

1494
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:28,458
I'll go now, Ms. Misato.

1495
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:29,833
Take care, Shinji.

1496
01:43:49,666 --> 01:43:50,958
Let's get back to work.

1497
01:43:51,041 --> 01:43:52,791
[Ritsuko] The ship is falling apart,

1498
01:43:52,875 --> 01:43:54,541
we don't have a main engine
or the auxiliary.

1499
01:43:54,625 --> 01:43:56,416
It's a miracle we're still afloat.

1500
01:43:56,791 --> 01:43:58,416
Yes, I agree.

1501
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:01,916
And we'll need to do another miracle
before the backup power runs out.

1502
01:44:02,708 --> 01:44:05,625
[Mari] <span>Eva Unit 8</span> improved
is overlapping-compliant.

1503
01:44:05,708 --> 01:44:09,500
By incorporating <span>Vessel of the Adams</span> ,
it's in an extra four-in-one state.

1504
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:13,750
Thanks to that, we're able to navigate
through the anti-universe pretty easily.

1505
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:16,666
OK, doggy.

1506
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:20,750
Your job is to somehow destroy <span>Unit 13</span>
before all the anti-L systems fail

1507
01:44:20,833 --> 01:44:22,583
and everybody above becomes core-ized.

1508
01:44:22,666 --> 01:44:25,875
That's the only way we're going
to be able to turn things around.

1509
01:44:25,958 --> 01:44:27,458
I understand.

1510
01:44:28,541 --> 01:44:30,500
[Mari] But Jeez, Gendoh sure is sly!

1511
01:44:30,958 --> 01:44:33,958
Taking advantage of the fact
we're in the anti-universe,

1512
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:37,333
he's doing quantum teleportation.
Catching him ain't gonna be easy.

1513
01:44:38,375 --> 01:44:41,041
It's OK, Ms. Mari. I'll go now.

1514
01:44:42,583 --> 01:44:43,625
Doggy!

1515
01:44:43,708 --> 01:44:47,750
There's a chance the Princess's soul
might be left over inside <span>Unit 13.</span>

1516
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:49,166
So the Princess...

1517
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:50,583
Asuka needs your help.

1518
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:53,041
I got it.

1519
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:54,750
Ayanami...

1520
01:45:02,625 --> 01:45:05,083
I will come for you,
no matter where you are!

1521
01:45:05,166 --> 01:45:06,166
So listen.

1522
01:45:07,083 --> 01:45:09,000
You wait for me. You hear, Shinji?

1523
01:45:10,625 --> 01:45:11,625
I'll wait for you.

1524
01:45:12,708 --> 01:45:13,833
Thank you.

1525
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:18,625
Good luck.

1526
01:45:19,833 --> 01:45:21,500
Are you fine with this, Rei?

1527
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,166
Ayanami...

1528
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:25,875
Shinji...

1529
01:45:27,041 --> 01:45:28,125
I'm sorry.

1530
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:32,708
I tried so that you wouldn't have
to pilot an <span>Eva</span> anymore, but I failed.

1531
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:35,708
It's OK. Thank you, Ayanami.

1532
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:37,541
I'll take it from here.

1533
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:40,041
Yes, please.

1534
01:45:46,916 --> 01:45:49,750
So, <span>Unit 1</span> 's pilot has awakened, has he?

1535
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:51,958
[Ibuki] I'm getting transmissions
from the anti-universe

1536
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:54,541
via <span>Unit 8.</span>
Improved <span> Eva Unit 1 </span> has reactivated.

1537
01:45:54,625 --> 01:45:56,833
[Kitakami]
That doesn't make any sense at all!

1538
01:45:56,916 --> 01:45:59,208
The troublemaker's synch rate was zero!

1539
01:45:59,291 --> 01:46:02,541
Could it be that Shinji's
true synchronization wasn't zero,

1540
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:04,916
but the closest value to zero?

1541
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:06,916
Yes, his synch rate is...

1542
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,208
... infinite.

1543
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:24,875
So, you've managed to transform it
to become Cassius, the spear of hope.

1544
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:31,041
You've got to stop this, Father!

1545
01:46:32,458 --> 01:46:34,583
No, I can't. I have deeds...

1546
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:36,916
to perforrrrrrrrrm!

1547
01:46:46,833 --> 01:46:51,416
What does that man plan to do
by forcefully causing Another Impact?

1548
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:54,708
There can be only one reason
for causing Another Impact.

1549
01:46:54,791 --> 01:46:57,625
He had a new spear created
to cause the Fourth Impact,

1550
01:46:57,708 --> 01:47:00,166
but then he reserved two spears

1551
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:03,541
until the very end,
probably to realize one single wish.

1552
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:05,125
[Kitakami] That's so stupid.

1553
01:47:05,208 --> 01:47:06,583
What an egotistical jerk!

1554
01:47:09,166 --> 01:47:11,250
We'll be reunited soon, Yui.

1555
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:13,458
[Shinji] What? I can't move!

1556
01:47:14,416 --> 01:47:16,000
Father, let me go!

1557
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:20,625
What is that?

1558
01:47:20,708 --> 01:47:22,875
[Gendoh] That is the Golgotha Object.

1559
01:47:22,958 --> 01:47:27,916
Some, who were not human beings,
left behind in this place six spears,

1560
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,541
the Adams, and the world of the Gods.

1561
01:47:31,083 --> 01:47:34,625
My wife, your mother, was here as well.

1562
01:47:34,708 --> 01:47:38,958
This is the Promised Land,
the place where everything started.

1563
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:41,791
There are things men cannot change,
except here.

1564
01:47:41,875 --> 01:47:45,875
This is the one and only place,
even Fate may be bent to one's will.

1565
01:47:52,166 --> 01:47:53,333
[Shinji] Where are we?

1566
01:47:55,416 --> 01:47:56,416
The <span>Eva</span> cage?

1567
01:47:57,916 --> 01:47:58,916
What is this place?

1568
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,166
[Gendoh] This is the world
of your memories.

1569
01:48:01,666 --> 01:48:02,666
Father?

1570
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:05,583
[Gendoh] Our senses
are useless in the anti-universe

1571
01:48:05,666 --> 01:48:07,166
to formulate tangible perception.

1572
01:48:08,166 --> 01:48:12,666
For that reason, the LCL has created
a virtual environment that's recognizable.

1573
01:48:13,833 --> 01:48:15,541
Hand over <span>Unit 1 </span> without delay.

1574
01:48:16,291 --> 01:48:19,875
Then, you too will be able
to meet your mother again.

1575
01:48:29,666 --> 01:48:32,500
[Gendoh] So you intend to put up
a futile resistance?

1576
01:48:33,333 --> 01:48:35,000
This is why I dislike children.

1577
01:48:49,916 --> 01:48:50,916
[Gendoh] Fine!

1578
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,916
We'll take the long way then.

1579
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,208
[exhaling with a loud roar]

1580
01:50:04,583 --> 01:50:05,583
[grunt of determination]

1581
01:50:15,666 --> 01:50:17,583
[ferocious growl]

1582
01:50:28,916 --> 01:50:29,750
[growl]

1583
01:50:41,416 --> 01:50:43,875
[Shinji] What's going on?
Our moves are the same.

1584
01:50:45,166 --> 01:50:46,333
This is hard.

1585
01:50:46,666 --> 01:50:48,708
[Gendoh] The two <span>Evas</span>
are perfect counterparts.

1586
01:50:49,416 --> 01:50:50,916
<span>Unit 1 </span> embodies hope.

1587
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,916
<span>Unit 13</span> , despair.

1588
01:50:53,083 --> 01:50:55,833
They are synchronized
and attuned to each other.

1589
01:50:56,041 --> 01:50:59,083
This also is a rite of passage
I must pass.

1590
01:50:59,958 --> 01:51:02,208
[gasps] Please stop this, Father!

1591
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:09,166
[Gendoh] It's useless.
Your feeble powers will not stop me.

1592
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:11,125
You still don't understand.

1593
01:51:36,291 --> 01:51:37,833
You still don't...

1594
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:48,375
[ferocious growl]

1595
01:51:48,458 --> 01:51:50,583
Your powers are meaningless.

1596
01:51:54,958 --> 01:52:00,500
Violence and fear are not the criteria
upon which our conflict can be resolved.

1597
01:52:03,833 --> 01:52:05,083
[whimpering]

1598
01:52:24,083 --> 01:52:25,208
[Gendoh] That's right.

1599
01:52:25,291 --> 01:52:28,375
This is not something
that can be resolved through might.

1600
01:52:31,041 --> 01:52:32,916
[Shinji] Yes, I want to talk to you.

1601
01:52:34,333 --> 01:52:35,333
Father?

1602
01:52:37,041 --> 01:52:38,625
Father, what are you trying to do here?

1603
01:52:38,708 --> 01:52:42,500
[Gendoh] I am doing something that can
only be done here at the Golgotha Object.

1604
01:52:42,583 --> 01:52:44,125
The Additional Impact

1605
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:48,583
that paves the way
through which I may slay the Gods.

1606
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:54,083
And so to that end,
I delivered two spears upon this land.

1607
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:59,000
[Ritsuko] MAGI-Copy predicts
that Commander Ikari will exhaust

1608
01:52:59,083 --> 01:53:01,541
the last two spears at the very end.

1609
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:04,083
Once all the spears are gone,

1610
01:53:04,166 --> 01:53:06,708
Shinji won't be able
to stop the initiation.

1611
01:53:06,791 --> 01:53:07,833
Then what the hell do we do?

1612
01:53:08,625 --> 01:53:11,750
We'll make a new spear
and deliver it to him.

1613
01:53:11,833 --> 01:53:14,875
That's impossible.
Just how do you plan to do that?

1614
01:53:14,958 --> 01:53:18,458
[Misato] While this ship was hijacked
and reverted to the Buße,

1615
01:53:18,541 --> 01:53:21,875
the ships used <span>The Black Moon</span>
as raw material to create unknown spears.

1616
01:53:22,666 --> 01:53:26,458
So there must be a way
this ship can create a new spear.

1617
01:53:26,541 --> 01:53:30,333
When <span>Wunder </span> is imbued with human
will it could work another miracle.

1618
01:53:30,416 --> 01:53:31,791
I believe in Ritsuko's intelligence

1619
01:53:31,875 --> 01:53:33,750
and the spirit residing

1620
01:53:33,916 --> 01:53:35,125
within WILLE and <span>Wunder</span> .

1621
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:37,125
That's absolutely reckless.

1622
01:53:37,208 --> 01:53:39,958
There's only data from when
the previous formulation took place.

1623
01:53:40,041 --> 01:53:41,458
I bet that's enough for you.

1624
01:53:43,041 --> 01:53:44,041
[phone rings]

1625
01:53:44,125 --> 01:53:45,458
I suppose. I'll give it a shot.

1626
01:53:45,541 --> 01:53:48,416
I think the key will lie
with the spinal linkage system.

1627
01:53:49,125 --> 01:53:51,708
Maya, I'm sorry,
but we'll have to do this on the fly.

1628
01:53:52,250 --> 01:53:53,875
No problem, XO senpai.

1629
01:53:54,416 --> 01:53:55,583
That's what we always do.

1630
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:57,916
Hey, Chief Boatswain!

1631
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,291
The backup power
and the spinal linkage system

1632
01:54:00,375 --> 01:54:01,375
is still good to go!

1633
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:04,250
Let's go ahead and work on swapping out
the components right here directly!

1634
01:54:04,333 --> 01:54:05,500
No, wait!

1635
01:54:05,583 --> 01:54:07,583
You need to get out of there!

1636
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:09,291
Just being nearby that thing
might harm you!

1637
01:54:09,375 --> 01:54:10,958
Duty calls for this last job!

1638
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:12,583
Let's do what we can, Chief Boatswain!

1639
01:54:13,958 --> 01:54:17,166
- This is the problem with young men.
- Right!

1640
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:19,166
Let's get started on aiding Shinji

1641
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:21,416
before Commander Ikari does
something nuts.

1642
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:22,666
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

1643
01:54:22,750 --> 01:54:26,791
<span>Eva 1 </span> pilot,
there's something I want to show you.

1644
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:32,250
[Shinji] That's...

1645
01:54:33,458 --> 01:54:34,583
Black Lilith?

1646
01:54:34,958 --> 01:54:38,083
I see your memory leads you
to see it as such.

1647
01:54:38,166 --> 01:54:40,166
This is <span>Evangelion Imaginary</span> .

1648
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:43,791
Dr. Katsuragi predicted
the existence of this <span> Eva</span> .

1649
01:54:44,125 --> 01:54:46,750
An <span>Eva </span> that is imaginary and fictional,

1650
01:54:47,083 --> 01:54:49,750
and does not exist in our world.

1651
01:54:50,166 --> 01:54:53,458
Only humanity,
with its ability to believe equally

1652
01:54:53,708 --> 01:54:56,041
in both fantasy and reality,

1653
01:54:56,125 --> 01:54:57,583
can perceive this <span>Eva</span> .

1654
01:54:57,666 --> 01:54:59,666
The spears of despair and hope

1655
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:03,208
feed off each other as sacrifice,
and act as a trigger.

1656
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:06,250
The imaginary and reality blend together.

1657
01:55:11,416 --> 01:55:14,500
Everything becomes
homogenized information.

1658
01:55:14,583 --> 01:55:18,041
And thus begins the Additional Impact,
the process that rewrites

1659
01:55:18,125 --> 01:55:21,250
not only our cognition,
but the entire world as well.

1660
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:31,625
This is the only means
by which my wish can be granted.

1661
01:55:53,875 --> 01:55:56,375
This is the Additional Impact?

1662
01:55:56,875 --> 01:56:00,625
[Ritsuko] Yes, that's probably
<span>Eva Imaginary.</span>

1663
01:56:00,708 --> 01:56:02,541
I never thought it really existed.

1664
01:56:02,625 --> 01:56:04,041
This is crazy.

1665
01:56:08,708 --> 01:56:10,458
It's totally nuts!

1666
01:56:57,041 --> 01:56:59,958
[Fuyutsuki] I see, so it finally begins.

1667
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:02,875
Ah, it's you.

1668
01:57:03,625 --> 01:57:06,208
It's been quite some time,
Professor Fuyutsuki.

1669
01:57:07,083 --> 01:57:08,083
But I gotta say,

1670
01:57:08,166 --> 01:57:11,291
isn't the L-containment field density
pretty damn high in this ship?

1671
01:57:11,666 --> 01:57:14,916
Well, this ship was
never designed to be manned.

1672
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,541
I realize I'm being reckless.

1673
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:21,291
The ray of light called hope
eternally shines upon humanity.

1674
01:57:21,375 --> 01:57:26,166
but humanity also drowns themselves,
clinging on to the malaise known as hope.

1675
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:27,708
I believe

1676
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:30,833
both Ikari and I have clung to the disease
called hope for far too long.

1677
01:57:31,458 --> 01:57:35,625
[Mari] Gendoh's wish is to be
the focal point of human instrumentality.

1678
01:57:35,708 --> 01:57:36,958
I can sympathize

1679
01:57:37,041 --> 01:57:38,833
with how you want to help him

1680
01:57:38,916 --> 01:57:42,333
or actually,
how your wish overlaps with his.

1681
01:57:42,958 --> 01:57:46,750
But sir, I'd rather not drag down
the whole of humanity with you,

1682
01:57:47,375 --> 01:57:48,375
you know what I mean?

1683
01:57:48,708 --> 01:57:51,958
I can understand. My job here is finished.

1684
01:57:52,541 --> 01:57:54,250
I've assembled the things you wanted.

1685
01:57:54,458 --> 01:57:56,208
Do as you see best fit...

1686
01:57:56,875 --> 01:57:59,041
... Mary Iscariot!

1687
01:58:00,875 --> 01:58:03,833
Wow, it's been forever
since I've been called that name.

1688
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,708
Righty-oh. Bye-bye.

1689
01:58:15,708 --> 01:58:16,708
Yui.

1690
01:58:18,166 --> 01:58:19,833
Is this what you wanted?

1691
01:58:38,583 --> 01:58:40,583
[weapons firing]

1692
01:58:46,166 --> 01:58:49,041
[roar of clanking metal]

1693
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:55,583
We've gotten it loose!
We can get this to work now!

1694
01:58:55,791 --> 01:58:58,458
[Ritsuko] Captain, we can do this
with just the crew that's with us here.

1695
01:58:59,166 --> 01:59:01,333
[Misato] Roger. All hands: abandon ship.

1696
01:59:01,416 --> 01:59:03,083
[emergency signal]

1697
01:59:03,166 --> 01:59:06,416
[Aoba] All hands: abandon ship.
I repeat. All hands! Abandon ship!

1698
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:09,916
Priority One to wounded personnel.
Head to the escape pods now.

1699
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:18,666
[Mari] All the <span>Vessels of the Adams</span> ,
the <span>Opfer Type Evas</span> , are here, I see.

1700
01:59:19,666 --> 01:59:20,666
As always

1701
01:59:20,750 --> 01:59:22,291
Professor Fuyutsuki sure runs
a tight ship.

1702
01:59:22,375 --> 01:59:23,541
Sorry but you guys...

1703
01:59:23,666 --> 01:59:25,125
Nahhhh!

1704
01:59:25,208 --> 01:59:28,333
You're gonna be meat to enhance...

1705
01:59:28,833 --> 01:59:29,833
Argh!

1706
01:59:33,666 --> 01:59:35,333
... my <span>Eva</span> 's overlapping!

1707
01:59:35,416 --> 01:59:37,208
[scary growl]

1708
01:59:41,041 --> 01:59:43,333
[Mari] Now we're at 8 plus 9 plus 10.

1709
01:59:56,125 --> 01:59:57,666
Plus eleven!

1710
02:00:05,916 --> 02:00:07,708
All right, just...

1711
02:00:08,208 --> 02:00:09,541
... one more to go!

1712
02:00:09,625 --> 02:00:12,291
[announcer] <span>Escape pods 1 through 4</span>
<span>have their hatches closed.</span>

1713
02:00:12,375 --> 02:00:15,250
<span>Any remaining crew must rush</span>
<span>to Escape Pod 5 immediately.</span>

1714
02:00:17,916 --> 02:00:20,083
I need to go.
I need to get back to the helm.

1715
02:00:20,458 --> 02:00:22,791
Our only job now is to survive.

1716
02:00:23,791 --> 02:00:25,416
No matter how bitter it feels.

1717
02:00:31,416 --> 02:00:35,875
[Ritsuko] Captain, the swapping out
is done. I think we can give it a go now.

1718
02:00:36,416 --> 02:00:37,500
Roger.

1719
02:00:37,583 --> 02:00:40,166
Direct helm control systems
to the Captain's seat.

1720
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:41,875
You are to evacuate immediately.

1721
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:42,875
Misato?

1722
02:00:42,958 --> 02:00:46,708
<span>Someone has to stay behind and make</span>
<span>absolutely sure activation starts.</span>

1723
02:00:46,791 --> 02:00:49,750
And I have final responsibility
over this ship.

1724
02:00:50,708 --> 02:00:53,625
<span>Ritsuko, look after the lives</span>
<span>that survive this,</span>

1725
02:00:53,708 --> 02:00:55,416
<span>all the children left behind.</span>

1726
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,291
I understand, Misato. I will do my best.

1727
02:01:02,666 --> 02:01:03,666
Thank you.

1728
02:01:25,541 --> 02:01:28,916
[Misato] We're low on EM power reserves.
When all else fails...

1729
02:01:29,666 --> 02:01:32,250
... legacy reaction propulsion engines

1730
02:01:33,083 --> 02:01:35,291
are the way to go, I guess.

1731
02:01:57,958 --> 02:02:00,500
[mournful screech of metal]

1732
02:02:08,791 --> 02:02:10,208
[Mari] The Lilin won't be...

1733
02:02:10,833 --> 02:02:12,000
... needing you anymore.

1734
02:02:12,083 --> 02:02:13,083
Rest in peace, <span>Adams</span> .

1735
02:02:14,458 --> 02:02:15,541
The <span>Wunder </span> is on the move.

1736
02:02:15,625 --> 02:02:17,833
I gotta join up with them.

1737
02:02:17,916 --> 02:02:18,958
But, oh boy...

1738
02:02:19,791 --> 02:02:21,666
Attempt to realize the instrumentality

1739
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:25,458
of both humanity's physical
and mental beings simultaneously?

1740
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,208
So Gendoh, what now?

1741
02:02:28,958 --> 02:02:31,291
Tell me, Father, what do you wish for?

1742
02:02:31,666 --> 02:02:35,833
I chose a world that you refused,
a world where there are no AT fields,

1743
02:02:36,125 --> 02:02:39,583
where humanity shares
one heart and mind equally.

1744
02:02:39,666 --> 02:02:43,708
There are no barriers between individuals,
nor disparities of wealth,

1745
02:02:43,791 --> 02:02:47,625
nor discrimination, nor wars, nor abuse,
nor pain, nor sorrow.

1746
02:02:47,708 --> 02:02:50,208
A world of only pure unsoiled souls.

1747
02:02:50,916 --> 02:02:53,875
And it is a very restful world

1748
02:02:54,333 --> 02:02:55,875
where I can be with Yui again.

1749
02:02:56,583 --> 02:02:58,500
Yui... Yui!

1750
02:02:58,583 --> 02:02:59,583
Yui!

1751
02:02:59,666 --> 02:03:02,250
Yui... Yui!

1752
02:03:02,333 --> 02:03:03,416
Yui, where are you?

1753
02:03:04,375 --> 02:03:05,958
Where are you, Yui?

1754
02:03:06,375 --> 02:03:07,875
Everybody here is Rei?

1755
02:03:07,958 --> 02:03:09,083
Where?

1756
02:03:09,458 --> 02:03:10,500
Where are you?

1757
02:03:10,833 --> 02:03:12,000
Yui?

1758
02:03:12,791 --> 02:03:15,333
Father, you have to stop this.

1759
02:03:15,916 --> 02:03:18,833
Why? What are you doing here Shinji?

1760
02:03:19,333 --> 02:03:21,416
I'm here because I want
to learn about you.

1761
02:03:22,708 --> 02:03:25,583
I stayed away from you
even when I was lonely.

1762
02:03:25,666 --> 02:03:31,291
I did that because I was afraid
I'd finally find out if you disliked me...

1763
02:03:32,416 --> 02:03:33,416
... or not.

1764
02:03:33,958 --> 02:03:35,125
I want to know now.

1765
02:03:35,583 --> 02:03:37,250
To know you, Father.

1766
02:03:41,083 --> 02:03:42,916
An AT field?

1767
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,250
But I got rid of my humanity!

1768
02:03:47,458 --> 02:03:50,333
Could it be that I am afraid of...

1769
02:03:51,375 --> 02:03:52,625
... Shinji?

1770
02:03:53,166 --> 02:03:54,458
Me?

1771
02:03:55,083 --> 02:03:56,291
This wasn't something...

1772
02:03:57,166 --> 02:03:58,500
... I should get rid of.

1773
02:03:58,583 --> 02:04:01,500
It was something
I should return to you, Father.

1774
02:04:07,083 --> 02:04:09,208
So, you were just like me.

1775
02:04:09,958 --> 02:04:12,125
Yes, I was.

1776
02:04:12,208 --> 02:04:15,666
Headphones cut me off
from the outside world.

1777
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:19,125
They protected me
from the noise of others,

1778
02:04:19,208 --> 02:04:21,541
helped me feign indifference.

1779
02:04:23,125 --> 02:04:27,333
But when I met Yui,
I no longer needed them.

1780
02:04:30,041 --> 02:04:31,958
[Yui] Have you chosen a name?

1781
02:04:32,041 --> 02:04:35,250
[Gendoh] Shinji if it's a boy.
Rei if it's a girl.

1782
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:38,500
[Yui] Shinji... Rei...

1783
02:04:38,958 --> 02:04:40,333
[chuckles]

1784
02:04:40,666 --> 02:04:42,666
[baby crying]

1785
02:04:46,916 --> 02:04:50,208
[Gendoh] I never knew my parents' love,
and yet I became a parent.

1786
02:04:51,166 --> 02:04:53,791
There is no question
this world is unstable,

1787
02:04:53,875 --> 02:04:56,083
imperfect, and irrational.

1788
02:04:56,166 --> 02:05:00,291
It is a world where things breakdown
if you take at face value what people say.

1789
02:05:00,375 --> 02:05:03,875
People say different things
at different times.

1790
02:05:03,958 --> 02:05:05,708
Which is the truth?

1791
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:08,166
What am I supposed to accept?

1792
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:11,541
Probably the speaker was insincere
in both instances.

1793
02:05:11,625 --> 02:05:12,750
They were speaking

1794
02:05:12,833 --> 02:05:14,916
what they really felt at the time.

1795
02:05:15,333 --> 02:05:17,458
I feared forming bonds with people.

1796
02:05:17,541 --> 02:05:20,041
I disliked a world brimming with them.

1797
02:05:20,125 --> 02:05:23,333
My childhood was filled
with days I was alone.

1798
02:05:24,083 --> 02:05:26,000
So I never felt lonely.

1799
02:05:26,583 --> 02:05:30,375
But there are those in society
that would scorn such an existence.

1800
02:05:30,958 --> 02:05:33,458
I hated going to other people's houses.

1801
02:05:33,541 --> 02:05:37,250
I despised having to go to the dwellings
of classmates that didn't interest me,

1802
02:05:37,333 --> 02:05:39,791
visiting relatives at their homes,

1803
02:05:39,875 --> 02:05:43,000
forced to confront
the circumstances of their lives,

1804
02:05:43,083 --> 02:05:45,500
and made to partake in their choirs.

1805
02:05:45,583 --> 02:05:47,625
Being together with others
was excruciating.

1806
02:05:48,583 --> 02:05:51,375
I simply wanted to be alone, always.

1807
02:05:51,458 --> 02:05:53,500
There were two things I liked as a child.

1808
02:05:53,583 --> 02:05:55,208
One was knowledge.

1809
02:05:55,291 --> 02:05:59,916
I could satiate the hunger of my heart
by gorging on information on my own terms.

1810
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,291
You need not be considerate to others
about knowledge.

1811
02:06:03,375 --> 02:06:06,375
I could serve upon myself as much
knowledge as time would allow me.

1812
02:06:07,666 --> 02:06:09,500
The other thing I liked was the piano.

1813
02:06:09,583 --> 02:06:13,333
A finely tuned wire would respond
accurately to the key that was touched.

1814
02:06:16,041 --> 02:06:17,875
There is no deception there.

1815
02:06:17,958 --> 02:06:20,291
No betrayals. No disappointments.

1816
02:06:20,375 --> 02:06:23,208
My existence
would be seamlessly translated

1817
02:06:23,291 --> 02:06:24,750
into a flow of sounds.

1818
02:06:24,833 --> 02:06:27,208
I liked this system. I liked being alone.

1819
02:06:28,375 --> 02:06:30,916
Neither I nor anyone else
would get hurt that way.

1820
02:06:31,875 --> 02:06:33,500
Alone, I could be at ease.

1821
02:06:35,166 --> 02:06:37,250
But, after encountering Yui,

1822
02:06:37,333 --> 02:06:38,416
I learned that living

1823
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:40,833
could be an enjoyable experience.

1824
02:06:41,625 --> 02:06:45,541
Yui alone accepted me for who I was.

1825
02:06:48,958 --> 02:06:50,458
After I lost Yui,

1826
02:06:50,916 --> 02:06:53,541
I no longer had the confidence
that I could live on

1827
02:06:53,625 --> 02:06:54,875
being alone.

1828
02:06:55,708 --> 02:06:59,708
This was the first time I tasted
the anguish of loneliness.

1829
02:07:00,833 --> 02:07:03,750
I could not bear the burden

1830
02:07:04,125 --> 02:07:05,541
of losing Yui.

1831
02:07:06,166 --> 02:07:10,083
I just wanted to cry
with my head resting on her bosom.

1832
02:07:10,708 --> 02:07:13,416
I just wanted to let myself be different

1833
02:07:14,333 --> 02:07:15,875
by being at her side.

1834
02:07:16,125 --> 02:07:19,125
I just wanted to make that wish come true.

1835
02:07:20,708 --> 02:07:23,958
Am I... Am I forbidden to meet Yui...

1836
02:07:25,208 --> 02:07:26,208
because I am weak?

1837
02:07:27,458 --> 02:07:28,458
Shinji...

1838
02:07:29,625 --> 02:07:32,458
I think you can't see her
because you're not willing

1839
02:07:32,541 --> 02:07:33,833
to accept your weaknesses.

1840
02:07:34,541 --> 02:07:36,541
You knew all along, didn't you,

1841
02:07:36,958 --> 02:07:37,958
Father...

1842
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
What's that?

1843
02:07:42,708 --> 02:07:44,291
Oh, it's Ms. Misato.

1844
02:07:45,666 --> 02:07:47,250
<span>Nyahhhh!</span>

1845
02:07:54,958 --> 02:07:57,875
["Joy to the World" playing]

1846
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:59,375
I'm not through yet!

1847
02:08:21,041 --> 02:08:24,875
Impossible!
All the holy spears have been lost.

1848
02:08:25,583 --> 02:08:28,875
There should be no new spears left
that could re-write the world.

1849
02:08:28,958 --> 02:08:33,166
[Mari] The Gods bestowed upon us Cassius,
the spear of hope, and Longinus,

1850
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:34,541
the spear of despair.

1851
02:08:34,625 --> 02:08:36,041
But even after losing those two spears,

1852
02:08:36,125 --> 02:08:38,041
the will to return the world
to how things were

1853
02:08:38,125 --> 02:08:40,375
created the spear, Gaius.

1854
02:08:41,166 --> 02:08:42,666
Yes, the WILLE spear.

1855
02:08:43,375 --> 02:08:45,416
Armed with knowledge and will power,

1856
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:48,625
humanity has been able to make it this far
without the help of the Gods.

1857
02:08:49,208 --> 02:08:50,458
Ms. Yui?

1858
02:09:05,458 --> 02:09:06,625
We got through it!

1859
02:09:11,875 --> 02:09:13,125
Mari, go to Shinji.

1860
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:14,583
[Mari] You got it!

1861
02:09:14,666 --> 02:09:17,333
- I'll bring him back!
- Promise?

1862
02:09:38,791 --> 02:09:43,083
[Gendoh] It seems a new spear will arrive
before I could be reunited with Yui.

1863
02:09:44,166 --> 02:09:45,208
How regrettable.

1864
02:09:49,583 --> 02:09:52,208
As your mother, this was
the only thing I could do for you.

1865
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:54,625
I'm sorry, Ryoji.

1866
02:10:06,291 --> 02:10:08,625
[Shinji] Thank you, Ms. Misato.

1867
02:10:09,833 --> 02:10:12,541
[Gendoh] You've learned to heed
the aspirations of others

1868
02:10:12,625 --> 02:10:13,875
and accept their deaths.

1869
02:10:13,958 --> 02:10:15,708
You've grown to be an adult, Shinji.

1870
02:10:18,208 --> 02:10:20,916
Until the very end, I wasn't sure

1871
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,958
if Shinji was needed as a building block

1872
02:10:24,333 --> 02:10:26,333
to reconstruct Yui.

1873
02:10:27,625 --> 02:10:30,625
Fulfilling a wish entails a sacrifice.

1874
02:10:31,375 --> 02:10:34,083
I thought a child was
a punishment upon myself.

1875
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,958
Not meeting my child,
not being there for him,

1876
02:10:38,958 --> 02:10:40,791
I thought that would be redemption.

1877
02:10:42,125 --> 02:10:45,791
I thought that would be best for my son.

1878
02:10:55,625 --> 02:10:57,583
[ringing bell]

1879
02:11:07,625 --> 02:11:08,958
I'm sorry.

1880
02:11:09,916 --> 02:11:11,625
Shinji.

1881
02:11:12,541 --> 02:11:13,541
I see.

1882
02:11:14,708 --> 02:11:16,041
So that's where you were.

1883
02:11:16,458 --> 02:11:17,625
Yui.

1884
02:11:30,541 --> 02:11:32,125
[Kaworu] Gendoh Ikari...

1885
02:11:32,208 --> 02:11:36,375
He was at the center of the circle,
the realization of human instrumentality.

1886
02:11:36,458 --> 02:11:37,916
From here on in, I'll take over.

1887
02:11:38,625 --> 02:11:39,666
So, Shinji Ikari.

1888
02:11:40,583 --> 02:11:41,791
What do you wish for?

1889
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:45,208
[Shinji] I'm fine. I think I can handle
pain and heartbreak.

1890
02:11:46,208 --> 02:11:48,708
I'm more worried
about saving Asuka and others.

1891
02:11:50,291 --> 02:11:53,666
Yes, I see.
You've already been able to stand back up

1892
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:57,000
in the real world,
not just in the imaginary one.

1893
02:11:59,041 --> 02:12:02,208
Yeah, I've got to settle
the score for what my father did.

1894
02:12:02,291 --> 02:12:03,291
Asuka!

1895
02:12:06,125 --> 02:12:08,625
[Asuka] I don't know Daddy.
Mommy isn't around.

1896
02:12:09,791 --> 02:12:11,083
That's why...

1897
02:12:11,416 --> 02:12:13,416
You don't need anyone, Asuka.

1898
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:18,416
I'm gonna make it so I don't need anyone.

1899
02:12:20,041 --> 02:12:22,750
Or else, things would be too painful.

1900
02:12:23,541 --> 02:12:25,083
Living is painful.

1901
02:12:30,208 --> 02:12:31,750
That's why I pilot my <span>Eva</span> .

1902
02:12:54,875 --> 02:12:57,375
People might hate me,
they may talk behind my back.

1903
02:12:57,458 --> 02:12:59,500
After all, that's all I'm worth.

1904
02:13:00,083 --> 02:13:01,875
As long as I can pilot my <span>Eva</span> .

1905
02:13:03,583 --> 02:13:05,250
I'll make my body and heart strong

1906
02:13:06,291 --> 02:13:08,166
so I don't need anyone.

1907
02:13:08,708 --> 02:13:11,000
So, praise me!

1908
02:13:11,583 --> 02:13:12,875
Recognize me.

1909
02:13:13,416 --> 02:13:15,500
Give me a place...

1910
02:13:16,750 --> 02:13:18,000
... where I can be.

1911
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:27,541
I just want...

1912
02:13:29,291 --> 02:13:31,041
... someone to pat me on my head.

1913
02:13:33,041 --> 02:13:35,208
[child crying sadly]

1914
02:13:44,166 --> 02:13:47,041
It's OK, Asuka. You are who you are.

1915
02:13:47,958 --> 02:13:49,791
And there's nothing wrong with that.

1916
02:13:59,083 --> 02:14:01,041
Am I asleep?

1917
02:14:02,916 --> 02:14:03,916
Idiot Shinji?

1918
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:06,791
I'm glad I could see you again.

1919
02:14:07,666 --> 02:14:09,333
I wanted to say something to you.

1920
02:14:10,708 --> 02:14:13,250
Thanks for saying you liked me.

1921
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:15,791
I liked you too.

1922
02:14:16,166 --> 02:14:17,166
Goodbye, Asuka.

1923
02:14:22,375 --> 02:14:25,166
Give my regards to Kensuke.

1924
02:14:25,250 --> 02:14:27,083
Princess, take care of yourself.

1925
02:14:33,791 --> 02:14:35,000
[Kaworu] Guess she's gone.

1926
02:14:35,625 --> 02:14:37,666
Shinji, won't you be lonely?

1927
02:14:38,208 --> 02:14:39,875
No, I'll be fine.

1928
02:14:40,583 --> 02:14:41,666
Now it's your turn,

1929
02:14:41,916 --> 02:14:42,916
Kaworu.

1930
02:14:44,666 --> 02:14:45,666
[Shinji] I now remember

1931
02:14:46,208 --> 02:14:49,291
I've been here before many times
and met you.

1932
02:14:49,875 --> 02:14:52,791
[Kaworu] Our names are alongside
each other in the <span> Book of Life</span> .

1933
02:14:52,958 --> 02:14:55,000
We'll keep on meeting each other.

1934
02:14:55,083 --> 02:14:57,666
I'm you, and I'm just like you.

1935
02:14:58,416 --> 02:14:59,875
That's why I was attracted to you.

1936
02:15:00,833 --> 02:15:02,500
I wanted to give you happiness.

1937
02:15:03,375 --> 02:15:04,458
[Shinji] Yes.

1938
02:15:04,916 --> 02:15:07,125
Kaworu, you're just like my father.

1939
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:09,458
That's why you piloted the same <span>Eva</span> .

1940
02:15:10,458 --> 02:15:12,750
Shinji, you're different
from how you usually are.

1941
02:15:13,541 --> 02:15:14,875
You're not going to cry?

1942
02:15:15,083 --> 02:15:18,750
No, crying only provides solace
for yourself.

1943
02:15:20,041 --> 02:15:22,500
Me crying won't save anyone.

1944
02:15:23,583 --> 02:15:26,875
- That's why I won't cry anymore.
- I see.

1945
02:15:27,666 --> 02:15:29,416
You have grown, haven't you, Shinji?

1946
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:32,166
I'll miss how you were before,
but I suppose that's fine.

1947
02:15:33,250 --> 02:15:35,541
[Shinji] Kaworu, I think I have to get rid

1948
02:15:35,625 --> 02:15:37,791
of your <span>Eva Unit 13 </span> too.

1949
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:41,916
[Kaworu]
Right. You're casting aside the <span>Evas</span> .

1950
02:15:42,750 --> 02:15:45,708
I'm sorry.
I misunderstood your happiness.

1951
02:15:46,166 --> 02:15:47,333
Exactly, sir.

1952
02:15:47,416 --> 02:15:50,541
You misconstrued your own happiness
with his, Commander Nagisa.

1953
02:15:52,083 --> 02:15:54,500
You didn't want to bring about
Shinji's happiness.

1954
02:15:54,583 --> 02:15:57,583
You wanted his happiness
to make you happy.

1955
02:16:00,625 --> 02:16:03,500
[Kaworu] The only thing that can end
my existence is vacuum decay.

1956
02:16:04,541 --> 02:16:06,916
That's why I have to
repeatedly play a role

1957
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,958
in this predestined circular narrative
for all of eternity.

1958
02:16:22,583 --> 02:16:24,166
Let's do this, hoping we can get along.

1959
02:16:26,375 --> 02:16:27,708
[sigh]

1960
02:16:28,708 --> 02:16:31,375
[Kaworu] You seek a world
with complementaries.

1961
02:16:31,708 --> 02:16:33,458
Shinji, you never change.

1962
02:16:33,875 --> 02:16:36,541
That's the very reason you chose him.

1963
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
and listed his name
in the <span>Book of Life</span> .

1964
02:16:39,416 --> 02:16:41,958
[Kaworu] Thank you.
You gave me salvation, Ryoji.

1965
02:16:42,041 --> 02:16:44,375
I'm honored, Commander Nagisa.

1966
02:16:44,916 --> 02:16:48,125
Oh, c'mon Ryoji. You can call me Kaworu.

1967
02:16:49,208 --> 02:16:51,708
No, sir, not yet, Commander Nagisa.

1968
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:55,333
Nagisa means shore intermediary,

1969
02:16:55,416 --> 02:16:57,250
between the land and the sea.

1970
02:16:57,583 --> 02:17:00,666
It's a fitting name for you
as the one that interlinks humanity.

1971
02:17:01,291 --> 02:17:02,291
First Angel,

1972
02:17:03,333 --> 02:17:05,750
and that which becomes the 13th Angel.

1973
02:17:07,041 --> 02:17:08,833
Let's let him take over for now.

1974
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:16,833
Perhaps you can take up working the earth
with me and Katsuragi once you retire?

1975
02:17:19,416 --> 02:17:20,916
[Shinji] Huh... yeah.

1976
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:22,958
That sounds nice.

1977
02:17:28,916 --> 02:17:30,250
You're the only one left,

1978
02:17:31,208 --> 02:17:32,708
Ayanami.

1979
02:17:33,208 --> 02:17:34,500
[Rei] I'm fine here.

1980
02:17:35,250 --> 02:17:38,500
[Shinji] Another one of you found a place
she could call home.

1981
02:17:39,208 --> 02:17:42,291
I'm sure Asuka will be able
to find her own new place as well.

1982
02:17:43,791 --> 02:17:45,250
[Rei] A happiness without an <span>Eva,</span>

1983
02:17:46,333 --> 02:17:48,250
that's what I wished for you, Shinji.

1984
02:17:50,208 --> 02:17:51,208
[Shinji] Yes.

1985
02:17:51,291 --> 02:17:53,458
So there's a life away from here for you.

1986
02:17:54,791 --> 02:17:56,166
- Really?
- Yes.

1987
02:17:57,083 --> 02:17:59,750
I'm going to choose a life
without <span>Evas </span> as well.

1988
02:18:01,375 --> 02:18:04,458
I won't rewind time or revert the world.

1989
02:18:04,916 --> 02:18:08,458
I'm just going to rewrite the world
into one that doesn't have <span> Evas</span> .

1990
02:18:08,625 --> 02:18:12,125
A world where new people can live.

Birth of a new world.

1992

Neon genesis.

1993
02:18:16,833 --> 02:18:18,000
Yeah.

1994
02:18:19,125 --> 02:18:21,375
And besides, Ms. Mari will come for me.

1995
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,208
So please, don't worry.

1996
02:18:24,083 --> 02:18:26,416
OK, I won't.

1997
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,375
Shinji, thank you.

1998
02:18:36,291 --> 02:18:38,333
I'll do it, Ayanami.

No, it isn't.

2006

I see now.

2007
02:19:22,041 --> 02:19:23,416
This is the reason why...

2008
02:19:24,791 --> 02:19:26,583
You were inside me all this time,

2009

Mother.

2010
02:19:35,875 --> 02:19:37,666
I finally understand.

2011

Father wanted to see Mother go.

2012
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:45,041
That's the god-slaying
